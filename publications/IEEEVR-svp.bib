  abstract =    { 
A common factor among current generation optical see-through augmented 
reality systems is fixed focal distance to virtual content. In this 
work, we investigate the issue of focus blur, in particular, the 
blurring caused by simultaneously viewing virtual content and physical 
objects in the environment at differing focal distances. We examine 
the application of dynamic sharpening filters as a straight forward, 
system independent, means for mitigating this effect improving the 
clarity of defocused AR content. We assess the utility of this method, 
termed SharpView, by employing an adjustment experiment in which users 
actively apply varying amounts of sharpening to reduce the perception 
of blur in AR content. Our experimental results validate the ability 
of our SharpView model to improve the visual clarity of focus blurred 
content, with optimal performance at focal differences well suited for 
near field AR applications.
