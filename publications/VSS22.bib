Virtual reality (VR) has advanced to include eye tracking technology, allowing 
for exploration of novel research questions, such as how our visual system 
coordinates eye movements within VR and adjusts to changes in perceptual focal 
depth. However, because of the vergence-accommodation conflict and a lack of 
ground truth distance in VR, researchers typically rely on subjective 
measurements of depth to calibrate stimuli and interpret the vergence demand 
required by the visual system. Therefore, to advance methods for objectively 
measuring perceptual depth, we investigated whether eye-tracking-enabled VR 
technology can be used to estimate perceptual depth. We analyzed eye tracking 
data from a visual discrimination task presented on a VR display (HTC Vive 
Pro). Two depth-dependent human visual system components (eye vergence and 
interpupillary distance (IPD)) were computed independently from 24 participants' 
eye tracker data. Results of our study indicate that when subjects shifted their 
gaze from a far distance to a near distance, the vergence angle increased, and 
IPD decreased. As expected, we observed the opposite pattern of vergence angle 
and IPD when shifting gaze from a near distance to a far distance. We also found 
that virtual information in the retina's peripheral region was observed 
perceptually closer than information in the foveal or parafoveal 
regions. Results suggest that our method successfully estimated perceptual depth 
changes in VR. These results could become a new tool for researchers to track 
changes in perceptual depth in real time. In addition, it could allow VR and AR 
developers to render virtual objects with respect to the perceptual depth plane, 
thereby improving the user experience in VR.
