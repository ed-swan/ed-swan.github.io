We have developed new illustrative visualization 
techniques inspired by artistic brush strokes for graphically 
representing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) National Hurricane Center's (NHC) hurricane 
advisory statements. To address the complexity of the advisory 
information and the limitations of traditional map displays, our 
techniques offer enhanced representations that map advisory 
data attributes to the visual features in brush strokes. By 
condensing the information into a single, comprehensible image, 
our new representations avoid many perceptual issues that affect 
the perception and cognition of the current NHC graphical 
products. In the current work, we describe the motivation and 
algorithmic details of two variants of our approach: the small 
brush stroke and long brush stroke methods. We also present 
the results of applying our techniques to the representation of 
hurricane advisories from the 2005 season, which include those 
of the infamous Hurricane Katrina. The results highlight the 
promise of our illustrative visualization methods as an effective 
approach for the dispensation of this vital information.
