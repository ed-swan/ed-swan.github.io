New approaches that combine the strengths of humans and machines are 
necessary to equip analysts with the proper tools for exploring 
today's increasing complex, multivariate data sets. In this paper, a 
visual data mining framework, called the Multidimensional Data 
eXplorer (MDX), is described that addresses the challenges of today's 
data by combining automated statistical analytics with a highly 
interactive parallel coordinates based canvas. In addition to several 
intuitive interaction capabilities, this framework offers a rich set of 
graphical statistical indicators, interactive regression analysis, 
visual correlation mining, automated axis arrangements and filtering, 
and data classification techniques. The current work provides a 
detailed description of the system as well as a discussion of key 
design aspects and critical feedback from domain experts.
