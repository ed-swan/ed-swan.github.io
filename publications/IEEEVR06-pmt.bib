  abstract =    { 
A fundamental problem in optical, see-through augmented reality (AR) 
is characterizing how it affects the perception of spatial layout and 
depth.  This problem is important because AR system developers need to 
both place graphics in arbitrary spatial relationships with real-world 
objects, and to know that users will perceive them in the same 
relationships.  Fur-thermore, AR makes possible enhanced perceptual 
techniques that have no real-world equivalent, such as x-ray vision, 
where AR users are supposed to perceive graphics as being located 
behind opaque surfaces. 
This paper reviews and discusses techniques for measuring egocentric 
depth judgments in both virtual and augmented envi-ronments.  It then 
describes a perceptual matching task and experimental design for 
measuring egocentric AR depth judgments at medium- and far-field 
distances of 5 to 45 meters.  The experiment studied the effect of 
field of view, the x-ray vision condition, multiple distances, and 
practice on the task.  The paper relates some of the findings to the 
well-known problem of depth underestimation in virtual environments, 
and further reports evidence for a switch in bias, from 
underestimating to overestimating the distance of AR-presented 
graphics, at ~23 meters.  It also gives a quantification of how much 
more difficult the x-ray vision condition makes the task, and then 
concludes with ideas for improving the experimental methodology.
