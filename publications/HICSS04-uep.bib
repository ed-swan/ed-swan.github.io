This paper reports on user interface design and evaluation for a mobile, 
outdoor, augmented reality (AR) application. This novel system, called the 
Battlefield Augmented Reality System (BARS), supports information presentation 
and entry for situation awareness in an urban war fighting setting. To our 
knowledge, this is the first time extensive use of usability engineering has 
been systematically applied to development of a real-world AR system. 
Our BARS team has applied a cost-effective progression of usability engineering 
activities from the very beginning of BARS development. We discuss how we first 
applied cycles of structured expert evaluations to BARS user interface 
development, employing user interface mockups representing occluded 
(non-visible) objects. Then we discuss how results of these evaluations informed 
our subsequent user-based statistical evaluations and formative evaluations, and 
present these evaluations and their outcomes. Finally, we discuss how and why 
this sequence of types of evaluation is cost-effective.
