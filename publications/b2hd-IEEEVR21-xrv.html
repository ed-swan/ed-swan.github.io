<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract"> Usable x-ray vision has long been a goal in augmented reality research anddevelopment. X-ray vision, or the ability to view and understand information presented through an opaque barrier, would be imminently useful across a variety of domains. Unfortunately, however, the effect of x-ray vision on situation awareness, an operator's understanding of a task or environment, has not been significantly studied. This is an important question; if x-ray vision does not increase situation awareness, of what use is it? Thus, we have developed an x-ray vision system, in order to investigate situation awareness in the context of action space distances.</p>
