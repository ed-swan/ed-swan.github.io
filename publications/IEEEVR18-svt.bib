For optical see-through head-mounted displays, the mismatch between a 
display's focal length and the real world scene inadvertently prevents 
users from simultaneously focusing on the presented virtual content 
and the scene. It has been shown that it is possible to ameliorate the 
out-of-focus blur for images with a known focus distance, by applying 
an algorithm called SharpView.  However, it remains unclear if 
SharpView also improves the readability and clarity of text rendered 
on the display.  In this study, we investigate whether users reported 
increased text clarity when SharpView was applied to a text label, and 
how the focal demand of the display, the focal distance to real world 
content, and gaze condition affect the result.  Our results indicate 
that, in non-fixated viewing, there is a significant user preference 
for SharpView-enhanced text strings.
