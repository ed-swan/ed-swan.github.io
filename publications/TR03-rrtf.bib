We describe a system for extracting ridges and ravines from elevation data.  The 
application context is a map-based military planning tool which allows users to 
select ridges and ravines by simple mouse clicks.  The extracted terrain 
features are complete in the application-specific sense that they conform to 
what our users expect a single ridge or ravine to look like.  Supervision is 
supported by a graphical user interface, which allows an analyst to modify 
algorithm parameters as well as perform intelligent mouse-based editing 
operations.  Among similar existing systems, ours is unique in that it focuses 
on the three classically difficult operations of (1) combining partial features, 
(2) splitting multiply-connected features, and (3) removing micro-terrain 
features for extracting high-level structure from classified pixels.
