  abstract =    { 
It has been noted anecdotally and through a small number of formal
studies that ambient lighting conditions and dynamic real-world 
backgrounds affect the usability of optical see-through augmented 
reality (AR) displays; especially so in outdoor environments. Our 
previous work examined these effects using painted posters as 
representative real-world backgrounds [1]. In this paper, we present a 
study that employs an experimental testbed that allows AR graphics to 
be overlaid onto real-world backgrounds as well as painted 
posters. Our results indicate that color blending effects of physical 
materials as backgrounds are nearly the same as their corresponding 
poster back- grounds, even though the colors of each pair are only a 
metameric match. More importantly, our results suggest that given the 
current capa- bilities of optical see-through head-mounted displays 
(oHMDs), the implications are, at a minimum, a reduced color gamut 
available to user interface (UI) designers. In worse cases, there are 
unknown or unexpected color interactions that no UI or system 
designers can plan for; significantly crippling the usability of the 
UI or altering the semantic interpretation of graphical 
elements. Further, our results support the concept of an adaptive AR 
system which can dynamically alter the color of UI elements based on 
predicted background color interactions.  These interactions can be 
studied and predicted through methods such as those presented in this 
work.
