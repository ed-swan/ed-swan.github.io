Augmented reality (AR) is an emerging technology, which allows 
computer-generated graphical information to be correlated with a person's view 
of the real world (see Figure 1).  These graphics can be placed in three 
positions relative to the real world: (1) in front of the view of the real 
world, (2) on the view of the real world, and (3) beyond the view of the real 
world.  For decades researchers have studied perception using artificial stimuli 
(both computer-generated and non-computer-generated), as well as natural 
scenery.  While many of the results will doubtless be found to apply to AR, AR 
itself provides a display capability which is qualitatively different from those 
which have been previously studied.  This is particularly true for graphics 
drawn on the view of the real world (which look like computer-drawn signs or 
labels), and drawn beyond the view of the real world (which provide an "x-ray 
vision" capability).
