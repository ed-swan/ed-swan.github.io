<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract">  Although augmented reality (AR) was first conceptualized over 35 years ago (Sutherland, 1968), until recently the field was primarily concerned with the engineering challenges associated with developing AR hardware and software.  Because AR is such a compelling medium with many potential uses, there is a need to further develop AR systems from a technology-centric medium to a user-centric medium.  This transformation will not be realized without systematic user-based experimentation.  This paper surveys and categorizes the user-based studies that have been conducted using AR to date.  Our survey finds that the work is progressing along three complementary lines of effort: (1) those that study low-level tasks, with the goal of understanding how human perception and cognition operate in AR contexts, (2) those that examine user task performance within specific AR applications or application domains, in order to gain an understanding of how AR technology could impact underlying tasks, and (3) those that examine user interaction and communication between collaborating users. </p>

Although augmented reality (AR) was first conceptualized over 35 years 
ago (Sutherland, 1968), until recently the field was primarily 
concerned with the engineering challenges associated with developing 
AR hardware and software.  Because AR is such a compelling medium with 
many potential uses, there is a need to further develop AR systems 
from a technology-centric medium to a user-centric medium.  This 
transformation will not be realized without systematic user-based 
experimentation.  This paper surveys and categorizes the user-based 
studies that have been conducted using AR to date.  Our survey finds 
that the work is progressing along three complementary lines of 
effort: (1) those that study low-level tasks, with the goal of 
understanding how human perception and cognition operate in AR 
contexts, (2) those that examine user task performance within specific 
AR applications or application domains, in order to gain an 
understanding of how AR technology could impact underlying tasks, and 
(3) those that examine user interaction and communication between 
collaborating users.
