<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract"> Triangulation by walking is a method that has been used to measure perceived distance, where observers walk a triangular path.  This method has been used at action space distances of approximately 1.5 to 30 meters.  In this work, a conceptual replication of these triangulation by walking methods are discussed and evaluated for use in measuring the perceived distance of an object seen through a window set into a wall. The motivation for this work is to use triangulation by walking to study how perceived distance operates when augmented reality (AR) is used to visualize objects located behind opaque surfaces, in an AR application termed &#147;x-ray vision.&#148;  This paper reports on experiences replicating an implementation of triangulation by walking as reported by Fukusima, Da Silva, and Loomis (1997).  Their method was conceptually replicated in both outdoor and indoor settings, and the method was further extended to measure perceived distances of objects seen through a wall.  These extensions are discussed in some detail, focusing on the modifications to the triangulation by walking method as well as the ramifications of these changes.  Problems arising from using triangular geometry in calculations of perceived target locations are also introduced, and an alternate method is proposed that works to diminish the problematic effects. </p>

Triangulation by walking is a method that has been used to measure perceived 
distance, where observers walk a triangular path.  This method has been used at 
action space distances of approximately 1.5 to 30 meters.  In this work, a 
conceptual replication of these triangulation by walking methods are discussed 
and evaluated for use in measuring the perceived distance of an object seen 
through a window set into a wall. The motivation for this work is to use 
triangulation by walking to study how perceived distance operates when augmented 
reality (AR) is used to visualize objects located behind opaque surfaces, in an 
AR application termed ``x-ray vision.''  This paper reports on experiences 
replicating an implementation of triangulation by walking as reported by 
Fukusima, Da Silva, and Loomis (1997).  Their method was conceptually replicated 
in both outdoor and indoor settings, and the method was further extended to 
measure perceived distances of objects seen through a wall.  These extensions 
are discussed in some detail, focusing on the modifications to the triangulation 
by walking method as well as the ramifications of these changes.  Problems 
arising from using triangular geometry in calculations of perceived target 
locations are also introduced, and an alternate method is proposed that works to 
diminish the problematic effects.
