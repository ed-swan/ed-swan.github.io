<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract">  We present a new rendering technique, termed <em>LOD-sprite</em> rendering, which uses a combination of a level-of-detail (LOD) representation of the scene together with reusing image <em>sprites</em> (previously rendered images).  Our primary application is accelerating terrain rendering.  The LOD-sprite technique renders an initial frame using a high-resolution model of the scene geometry. It renders subsequent frames with a much lower-resolution model of the scene geometry and texture-maps each polygon with the image sprite from the initial high-resolution frame.  As it renders these subsequent frames the technique measures the error associated with the divergence of the view position from the position where the initial frame was rendered.  Once this error exceeds a user-defined threshold, the technique re-renders the scene from the high-resolution model.  We have efficiently implemented the LOD-sprite technique with texture-mapping graphics hardware.  Although to date we have only applied LOD-sprite to terrain rendering, it could easily be extended to other applications.  We feel LOD-sprite holds particular promise for real-time rendering systems. </p>
