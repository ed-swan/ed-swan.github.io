  abstract =    { 
An experiment is reported in which the relative effectiveness of color coding, 
texture coding, and no coding of target borders to speed visual search is 
determined. The following independent variables were crossed in a 
within-subjects factorial design: Color coding (present or not), Texture coding 
(present or not), Distance between similarly coded targets (near or far), Group 
size of similarly coded targets (1, 2, 3, or 4), and a Replication factor of 
target Border width (10, 20, or 30 pixels). Search times, errors, and subjective 
rankings of the coding methods were recorded. Results showed that color coding 
improved search time compared to no coding, but that texture coding was not 
effectively used by subjects, resulting in nearly identical times to uncoded 
targets. Subjective preference rankings reflected the time data. The adequate 
power of the experiment along with the results of preparatory pilot studies lead 
us to the conclusion that texture coding is not an effective coding method for 
improving visual search time.
