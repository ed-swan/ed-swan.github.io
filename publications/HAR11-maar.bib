This chapter reviews military benefits and requirements that have led
to a series of research efforts in augmented reality (AR) and related
systems over the past few decades, beginning with the DARPA-funded
research of Ivan Sutherland that initiated the field of interactive
computer graphics. We will briefly highlight a few of the research
projects that have advanced the field over the past five decades. We
will then examine in detail the Battlefield Augmented Reality System
at the Naval Research Laboratory, which was the first system developed
to meet the needs of the dismounted warfighter. Developing this system
has required advances, in particular in the user interface (UI) and
human factors. We summarize our research and place it in the context
of the field.
