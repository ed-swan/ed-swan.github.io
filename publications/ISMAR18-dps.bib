  abstract =    {
The use of Optical See-Through (OST) technology for presenting
Augmented Reality (AR) experiences is becoming more common.  However, 
OST-AR displays require a calibration procedure, in order to determine 
the location of the user's eyes.  Currently, the predominantly cited 
manual calibration technique is the Single Point Active Alignment 
Method (SPAAM).  However, with the SPAAM technique, there remains 
uncertainty about the causes of poor calibration results.  This paper 
reports an experiment which examined the influence of two factors on 
SPAAM accuracy and precision: alignment point distribution, and user 
posture.  Alignment point distribution is examined at user-centered 
reaching distances, 0.15 to 0.3 meters, as well as 
environment-centered room-scale distances, 0.5 to 2.0 meters.  User 
posture likely contributes to misalignment error, and is examined at 
the levels of sitting and standing.  In addition, a control condition 
replaces the user with a rigidly-mounted camera, and mounts the OST 
display on a precisely-adjustable tripod.  The experiment finds that 
user-centric distributions are more accurate than environment-centric 
distributions, and, somewhat surprisingly, that the user's posture has 
no effect.  The control condition replicates these findings.  The 
implication is that alignment point distribution is the predominant 
mode for induction of calibration error for SPAAM calibration 
procedures.
