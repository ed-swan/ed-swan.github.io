  abstract =    { 
This paper provides a classification of perceptual issues in augmented 
reality, created with a visual processing and interpretation 
pipeline in mind. We organize issues into ones related to the environment, 
capturing, augmentation, display, and individual user 
differences. We also illuminate issues associated with more recent 
platforms such as handhelds or projector-camera systems. 
Throughout, we describe current approaches to addressing these 
problems, and suggest directions for future research.
