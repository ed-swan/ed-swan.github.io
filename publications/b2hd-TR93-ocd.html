<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract">  This report describes a collision detection system which uses the N-objects octree algorithm. This technique is described by Shaffer & Herb in an unpublished report [1991], and subsequently published in IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation [Shaffer & Herb 1992]. The algorithm was developed and tested with the Hook [1992] animation system. The algorithm and its implementation are described, with particular attention to the design of the octree component as an abstract data type (ADT). In addition, timing test results are reported. </p>
