The growing prevalence of hand and gesture tracking technology has led 
to an increased availability of consumer level devices, such as the 
Leap Motion controller, and also facilitated the inclusion of similar 
hardware into forth coming head mounted display offerings, including 
the Microsoft HoloLens and Moverio Pro BT-2000. In this video, we 
demonstrate the utility of the Leap Motion for calibrating optical 
see-through augmented reality systems by employing a variation on 
Tuceryan and Navab's Single Point Active Alignment Method [3]. We also 
showcase a straightforward method for calibrating the coordinate frame 
of the Leap Motion to a secondary tracking system by employing 
absolute orientation algorithms [2, 1, 4], allowing us to properly 
transform and visualize hand and finger tracking data from the user's 
viewpoint. Our combined display and coordinate frame calibration 
techniques produce a viable mechanism for not only intuitive 
interaction with virtual objects but also the creation of natural 
occlusion between computer generated content and the user 
themselves. We believe that these techniques will be pivotal in the 
development of novel consumer applications for next generation head 
mounted display hardware.
