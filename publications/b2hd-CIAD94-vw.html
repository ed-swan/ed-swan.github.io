<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract">  In this paper we describe a system that allows a power wheelchair user to drive through a virtual architectural environment. The system allows architects and designers to visualize an environment, test the environment for handicapped accessibility, and determine whether the environment meets design standards such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. First we describe the system itself, including its hardware and software components and its user interface. Then we discuss architectural and design considerations. </p>
