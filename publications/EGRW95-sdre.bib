Reconstruction is imperative whenever an image or a volume needs to be resampled 
as a result of an affine or perspective transformation, texture mapping, or 
volume rendering. We present a new method for the characterization and 
measurement of reconstruction error. Our method, based on spatial domain error 
analysis, uses approximation theory to develop error bounds. We provide, for the 
first time, an efficient way to guarantee an error bound at every point by 
varying the filter size. We go further to support position-adaptive and 
data-adaptive reconstruction which adjust filter size to the location of 
reconstruction and the data in its vicinity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 
our methods with suitable 2D and 3D examples.
