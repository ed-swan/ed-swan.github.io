  abstract = {
Recently, extended reality (XR) displays including augmented reality (AR) and
virtual reality (VR) have integrated eye tracking capabilities, which could 
enable novel ways of interacting with XR content. The vergence angle of the eyes 
constantly changes according to the distance of fixated objects. Here we 
measured vergence angle for eye fixations on real and simulated target objects 
in three different environments: real objects in the real-world (real), virtual 
objects in the real-world (AR), and virtual objects in the virtual world (VR) 
using gaze data from an eye-tracking device. In a repeated-measures design with 
13 participants, Gaze-measured Vergence Angle (GVA) was measured while 
participants fixated on targets at varying distances. As expected, results 
showed a significant main effect of target depth such that increasing GVA was 
associated with closer targets. However, there were consistent individual 
differences in baseline GVA. When these individual differences were controlled 
for, there was a small but statistically-significant main effect of environment 
(real, AR, VR). Importantly, GVA was stable with respect to the starting depth 
of previously fixated targets and invariant to directionality (convergence 
vs. divergence). In addition, GVA proved to be a more veridical depth estimate 
than subjective depth judgments.
