The ever-increasing power of computers and hardware rendering systems has, to 
date, primarily motivated the creation of visually rich and perceptually 
realistic virtual environment (VE) applications.  Comparatively very little 
effort has been expended on the user interaction components of VEs.  As a 
result, VE user interfaces are often poorly designed and are rarely evaluated 
with users.  Although usability engineering is a newly emerging facet of VE 
development, user-centered design and evaluation in VEs as a practice still lags 
far behind what is needed. 
In this article we present a structured, iterative methodology for the 
user-centered design and evaluation of VE user interaction.  Figure 1 
illustrates our basic technique: we recommend performing (1) user task analysis, 
followed by (2) expert guidelines-based evaluation, followed by (3) formative 
user-centered evaluation, and finally by (4) summative comparative evaluation. 
In this article we first give some motivation and background for our 
methodology, and then we describe each of these techniques in some detail.  We 
then discuss how we applied these techniques to a real-world battlefield 
visualization virtual environment, and finally discuss why this approach 
provides a cost-effective strategy for assessing and iteratively improving user 
interaction in VEs.
