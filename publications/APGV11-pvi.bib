A frequently observed problem in medium-field virtual environments is 
the underestimation of egocentric depth.  This problem has been 
described numerous times and with widely varying degrees of severity, 
and although there has been considerable progress made in modifying 
observer behavior to compensate for these misperceptions, the question 
of why these errors exist is still an open issue.  This paper presents 
the findings of a series of experiments, comprising 111 participants, 
that attempts to identify and quantify the source of a pattern of 
adaptation and improved depth judgment accuracy over time scales of 
less than one hour.  Taken together, these experiments suggest that 
peripheral visual information is an important source of information 
for the calibration of movement within medium-field virtual 
environments.
