This work presents, via an in-depth case study, how parallel 
coordinates coupled with statistical analysis can be used for more 
effective knowledge discovery and confirmation in complex, environmental 
data sets.  Advanced visual interaction techniques 
such as dynamic axis scaling, conjunctive parallel coordinates, 
statistical indicators, and aerial perspective shading are 
combined into an interactive geovisual analytics system. 
Moreover, the system facilitates statistical processes such 
as stepwise regression and correlation analysis to assist in the 
identification and quantification of the most significant predictors 
for a particular dependent variable. Using a systematic workflow, 
this approach is demonstrated via a North Atlantic hurricane climate 
study in close collaboration with a domain expert.  By revealing 
several important physical associations, the case study reveals 
that the visual analytics approach facilitates a deeper 
understanding of multidimensional climate data sets when compared to 
traditional techniques.
