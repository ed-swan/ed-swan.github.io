We present a visual analytics framework for exploring the textual 
relationships in computer forensics. Based on a task analysis study 
performed with practitioners, our tool addresses the inefficiency of 
searching for related text documents on a hard drive. Our framework 
searches both allocated and unallocated sectors for text and performs 
some pre-analysis processing; this information is then presented via a 
visualization that displays both the frequency of relevant terms and 
their location on the disk. We also present a case study that 
demonstrates our framework's operation, and we report on an informal 
evaluation conducted with forensics analysts from the Mississippi 
State Attorney General's Office and National Forensics Training 
Center.
