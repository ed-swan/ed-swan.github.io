In this paper we describe a battlefield visualization system, called Dragon, 
which we have implemented on a virtual reality responsive workbench.  The Dragon 
system has been successfully deployed as part of two large military exercises: 
the Hunter Warrior advanced warfighting experiment, in March 1997, and the Joint 
Counter Mine advanced concept tactical demonstration, in August and September 
1997.  We describe battlefield visualization, the Dragon system, and the 
workbench, and we describe our experiences as part of these two real-world 
deployments, with an emphasis on lessons learned and needed future work.
