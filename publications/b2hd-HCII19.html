<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract"> One of the biggest issues facing VR as a platform is the limitation ofthe userâs physical space. Not everyone has a lab, empty warehouse, or open space in their home or office, and even if they do, the hardware also limits the physical space the user can take advantage of. For example, the HTC Vive hardware limits the play area to 12.5m^2, assuming the user does not add additional lighthouses. Fitting the entirety of the environment within few square meters is a strict limitation for many applications. A method of moving the user within a larger space is needed, but current methods come with a trade-off. Determining the best movement method for an application is necessary to ensure a proper experience for the user. </p>
