<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract"> Augmented Reality (AR) interfaces have been studied extensively over the last few decades, with a growing number of user-based experiments. In this paper, we systematically review most AR papers published between 2005 and 2014 that include user studies. A total of 291 papers have been reviewed and classified based on their application areas. The primary contribution of the review is to present the broad landscape of user-based AR research, and to provide a high-level view of how that landscape has changed. We also identify areas where there have been few user studies, and opportunities for future research. This poster describes the methodology of the review and the classifications of AR research that have emerged.</p>
