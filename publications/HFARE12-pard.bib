  abstract = { 
Head-worn displays have been an integral part of augmented reality since the 
inception of the field. However, due to numerous difficulties with designing 
using such unique hardware, the perceptual capabilities of users suffer when 
looking at either the virtual or real portions of the augmented reality.We 
discuss the perceptual background and a series of experiments --- in the 
literature and in our laboratories --- measuring the degradation of basic 
functions of the human visual system when using head-worn augmented reality 
displays. In particular, we look at loss of visual acuity and contrast (and how 
these in turn affect text legibility), distortion of perceived colors, and 
difficulties of fusing stereo imagery. We discuss the findings and the 
implications for head-worn display design.
