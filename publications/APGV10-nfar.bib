  abstract =    { 
In this paper we describe an apparatus and experiment that measured 
depth judgments in augmented reality at near-field distances of 34 to 
50 centimeters.  The experiment compared perceptual matching, a 
closed-loop task for measuring depth judgments, with blind reaching, a 
visually open-loop task for measuring depth judgments.  The experiment 
also studied the effect of a highly salient occluding surface 
appearing behind, coincident with, and in front of a virtual object. 
The apparatus and closed-loop matching task were based on previous 
work by Ellis and Menges.  The experiment found maximum average depth 
judgment errors of 5.5 cm, and found that the blind reaching judgments 
were less accurate than the perceptual matching judgments.  The 
experiment found that the presence of a highly-salient occluding 
surface has a complicated effect on depth judgments, but does not lead 
to systematically larger or smaller errors.
