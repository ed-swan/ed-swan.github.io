The ever-increasing power of computers and hardware rendering systems has, to 
date, primarily motivated the creation of visually rich and perceptually 
realistic virtual environment (VE) applications.  Comparatively very little 
effort has been expended on the user interaction components of VEs.  As a 
result, VE user interfaces are often poorly designed and are rarely evaluated 
with users.  Although usability engineering is a newly emerging facet of VE 
development, user-centered design and usability evaluation in VEs as a practice 
still lags far behind what is needed. 
This paper presents a structured, iterative approach for the user-centered 
design and evaluation of VE user interaction.  This approach consists of the 
iterative use of expert heuristic evaluation, followed by formative usability 
evaluation, followed by summative evaluation.  We describe our application of 
this approach to a real-world VE for battlefield visualization, describe the 
resulting series of design iterations, and present evidence that this approach 
provides a cost-effective strategy for assessing and iteratively improving user 
interaction design in VEs.  This paper is among the first to report applying an 
iterative, structured, user-centered design and evaluation approach to VE user 
interaction design.
