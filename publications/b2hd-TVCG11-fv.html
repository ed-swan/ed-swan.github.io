<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract"> 
This paper presents a 2D flow visualization user study that we conducted to
evaluate particular geometry-based and texture-based techniques, namely,
grid-based variable-size arrows, evenly spaced streamlines, and LIC variants
(basic, oriented, and enhanced versions) coupled with a colorwheel and/or
rainbow color map. To reduce data-related bias, templatebased explicit flow
synthesis was adopted for creating a wide variety of symmetric flows with
similar topological complexity. To suppress task-related bias, pattern-based
implicit task design was employed, addressing critical point recognition,
critical point classification (saddle, center, focus), and symmetric pattern
categorization (x-axis/y-axis/center symmetry). In addition, variableduration
and fixed-duration measurement mechanisms were utilized for lightweight
precision-critical and heavyweight judgmentintensive flow analysis tasks,
respectively, to record visualization effectiveness. These anti-bias approaches
allowed us to obtain as convincing results as possible from the user study. Our
study shows that a texture-based dense representation with accentuated flow
streaks, such as enhanced LIC, enables intuitive perception of the flow, while a
geometry-based integral representation with uniform density control, such as
evenly spaced streamlines, may exploit visual interpolation to facilitate mental
reconstruction of the flow. It is also shown that inappropriate color mapping
(e.g., colorwheel) may add distractions to a flow representation.
