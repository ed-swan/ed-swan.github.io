We present a comparative study of user performance with tasks involving 
navigation, visual search, and geometric manipulation, in a map-based 
battlefield visualization virtual environment (VE).  Specifically, our 
experiment compared user performance of the same task across four different VE 
platforms: desktop, cave, workbench, and wall.  Independent variables were 
platform type, stereopsis (stereo, mono), movement control mode (rate, 
position), and frame of reference (egocentric, exocentric).  Overall results 
showed that users performed tasks fastest using the desktop and slowest using 
the workbench.  Other results are detailed below.  Notable is that we de-signed 
our task in an application context, with tasking much closer to how users would 
actually use a real-world battlefield visualization system.  This is very 
uncommon for comparative studies, which are usually designed with abstract tasks 
to minimize variance.  This is, we believe, one of the first and most complex 
studies to comparatively examine, in an application context, this many key 
variables affecting VE user interface design.
