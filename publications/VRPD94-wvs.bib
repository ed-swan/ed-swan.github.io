In this paper we describe a system which allows a power wheelchair user to drive 
through a virtual architectural environment. The system addresses the current 
lack of methods for evaluating a disabled person in order to match them with a 
suitable power wheelchair control mechanism. First we describe the system 
itself, including its hardware and software components and its user 
interface. Then we discuss both using the system to evaluate user proficiency 
and using the system as an architectural design tool, and we briefly describe 
our experience with a disabled person using the system. We conclude with a brief 
discussion of future plans.
