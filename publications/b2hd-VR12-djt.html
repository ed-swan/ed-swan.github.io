<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract">  In this abstract we describe an experiment that measured depth judgments in optical see-through augmented reality (AR) at near-field reaching distances of &nbsp;24 to &nbsp;56 cm. The 2 x 2 experiment crossed two depth judgment tasks, perceptual matching and blind reaching, with two different environments, a real-world environment and an augmented reality environment. We designed a task that used a direct reaching gesture at constant percentages of each participant's maximum reach; our task was inspired by previous work by Tresilian and Mon-Williams [6] that found very accurate blind reaching results in a real-world environment. </p>

In this abstract we describe an experiment that measured depth 
judgments in optical see-through augmented reality (AR) at near-field 
reaching distances of ~24 to ~56 cm. The 2 x 2 experiment 
crossed two depth judgment tasks, perceptual matching and blind 
reaching, with two different environments, a real-world environment 
and an augmented reality environment. We designed a task 
that used a direct reaching gesture at constant percentages of each 
participant's maximum reach; our task was inspired by previous 
work by Tresilian and Mon-Williams [6] that found very accurate 
blind reaching results in a real-world environment.
