As the first part of a Analyze-Visualize-Validate cycle, we have initiated a 
domain analysis of email computer forensics to determine where visualization may 
be beneficial. To this end, we worked with police detectives and other forensics 
professionals. However, the process of designing and executing such a study with 
real-world experts has been a non-trivial task. This paper presents our efforts 
in this area and the lessons learned as guidance for other practitioners.
