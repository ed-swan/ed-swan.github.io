  abstract = { 
Effectively evaluating optical see-through (OST) head-mounted display 
(HMD) calibration is problematic and largely relies on feedback from 
the user. Studies evaluating OST HMD calibration, such as those by 
McGarrity, Tang, and Navab et al. [2, 3, 1], utilize user interaction 
methods, such as touch pads, to facilitate on-line evaluation and 
correction of calibration results. In all of these studies, however, 
only the users themselves receive any visual feedback related to the 
calibration quality or the corrective actions taken to improve it. In 
this video, we present the use of standard frustum visualization to 
provide calibration quality information to the researcher in real 
time. We use a standard Single Point Active Alignment Method (SPAAM) 
calibration, [4], after which both the eye location estimate and 
resulting intrinsic values are displayed superimposed onto the 
user. Presenting the eye position relative to the user's head benefits 
studies on system error sources, and rendering on-screen visuals 
also allows outside observers to identify calibration issues and offer 
corrective suggestions. We believe that techniques, such as frustum 
visualization, will expand the amount of information available for 
evaluating calibration results, and will greatly aid those 
investigating new and improved calibration procedures.
