  abstract =    { 
<p>Advances in optical see-through head-mounted display technology have 
yielded a number of consumer accessible options, such as the Google 
Glass and Epson Moverio BT-200, and have paved the way for promising 
next generation hardware, including the Microsoft HoloLens and Epson 
Pro BT-2000. The release of consumer devices, though, has also been 
accompanied by an ever increasing need for standardized optical 
see-through display calibration procedures easily implemented and 
performed by researchers, developers, and novice users 
alike. Automatic calibration techniques offer the possibility for 
ubiquitous environment independent solutions, un-reliant upon user 
interaction. These processes, however, require the use of additional 
eye tracking hardware and algorithms not natively present in current 
display offerings. User dependent approaches, therefore, remain the 
only viable option for effective calibration of current generation 
optical see-through hardware. Inclusion of depth sensors and hand 
tracking cameras, promised in forthcoming consumer models, offer 
further potential to improve these manual methods and provide 
practical intuitive calibration options accessible to a wide user 
base.</p> 
<p>In this work, we evaluate the accuracy and precision of manual optical 
see-through head-mounted display calibration performed using a Leap 
Motion controller. Both hand and stylus based methods for monocular 
and stereo procedures are examined, along with several on-screen 
reticle designs for improving alignment context during 
calibration. Our study shows, that while enhancing the context of 
reticles for hand based alignments does yield improved results, Leap 
Motion calibrations performed with a stylus offer the most accurate 
and consistent performance, comparable to that found in previous 
studies for environment-centric routines. In addition, we found that 
stereo calibration further improved precision in every case. We 
believe that our findings not only validate the potential of hand and 
gesture based trackers in facilitating optical see-through calibration 
methodologies, but also provide a suitable benchmark to help guide 
future efforts in standardizing calibration practices for user 
friendly consumer systems.</p>
