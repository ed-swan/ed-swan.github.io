abstract =      {
Many augmented reality (AR) applications operate within near-field
reaching distances, and require matching the depth of a virtual object 
with a real object.  The accuracy of this matching was measured in 
three experiments, which examined the effect of focal distance, age, 
and brightness, within distances of 33.3 to 50 cm, using a 
custom-built AR haploscope.  Experiment I examined the effect of focal 
demand, at the levels of collimated (infinite focal distance), 
consistent with other depth cues, and at the midpoint of reaching 
distance.  Observers were too young to exhibit age-related reductions 
in accommodative ability.  The depth matches of collimated targets 
were increasingly overestimated with increasing distance, consistent 
targets were slightly underestimated, and midpoint targets were 
accurately estimated.  Experiment II replicated Experiment I, with 
older observers.  Results were similar to Experiment I. 
Experiment III replicated Experiment I with dimmer targets, using 
young observers.  Results were again consistent with Experiment I, 
except that both consistent and midpoint targets were accurately 
estimated.  In all cases, collimated results were explained by a 
model, where the collimation biases the eyes' vergence angle outwards 
by a constant amount.  Focal demand and brightness affect near-field 
AR depth matching, while age-related reductions in accommodative 
ability have no effect.
