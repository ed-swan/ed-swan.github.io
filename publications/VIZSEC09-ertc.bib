We describe the development of a set of tools for analyzing the 
textual contents of digital forensic evidence for the purpose of 
enhancing an investigator's ability to discover information quickly 
and efficiently.  By examining the textual contents of files and 
unallocated space, relationships between sets of files and clusters 
can be formed based on the information that they contain.  Using the 
information gathered from the evidence through the analysis tool, the 
visualization tool can be used to search through the evidence in an 
organized and efficient manner.  The visualization depicts both the 
frequency of relevant terms and their location on disk. We also 
discuss a task analysis with forensics officers to motivate the 
design.
