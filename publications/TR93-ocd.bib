This report describes a collision detection system which uses the N-objects 
octree algorithm. This technique is described by Shaffer & Herb in an 
unpublished report [1991], and subsequently published in IEEE Transactions on 
Robotics and Automation [Shaffer & Herb 1992]. The algorithm was developed and 
tested with the Hook [1992] animation system. The algorithm and its 
implementation are described, with particular attention to the design of the 
octree component as an abstract data type (ADT). In addition, timing test 
results are reported.
