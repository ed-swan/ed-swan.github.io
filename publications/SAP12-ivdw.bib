  abstract =    { 
A previous study indicated that peripheral visual information strongly 
affects the judgment of egocentric distances for users of immersive 
virtual environments.  The experiment described in this document aimed 
to investigate if these effects could be explained in terms of changes 
in gait caused by visual information in the extreme periphery.  Three 
conditions with varying degrees of peripheral occlusion were tested 
and participants' walking characteristics measured.  The results 
indicate that the improvements in distance judgments, as peripheral 
information increases, can only partially be explained in terms of 
gait modification, but likely involve both changes in the 
characteristics of gait and other spatial or movement parameters.
