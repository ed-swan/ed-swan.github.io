One of the biggest issues facing VR as a platform is the limitation of
the userâ€™s physical space. Not everyone has a lab, empty warehouse, or 
open space in their home or office, and even if they do, the hardware 
also limits the physical space the user can take advantage of. For 
example, the HTC Vive hardware limits the play area to 12.5m^2, 
assuming the user does not add additional lighthouses. Fitting the 
entirety of the environment within few square meters is a strict 
limitation for many applications. A method of moving the user within a 
larger space is needed, but current methods come with a 
trade-off. Determining the best movement method for an application is 
necessary to ensure a proper experience for the user.
