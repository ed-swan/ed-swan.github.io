<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract"> A haploscope is an optical system which produces a carefullycontrolled virtual image.  Since the development of Wheatstone's original stereoscope in 1838, haploscopes have been used to measure perceptual properties of human stereoscopic vision.  This paper presents an augmented reality (AR) haploscope, which allows the viewing of virtual objects superimposed against the real world.  Our lab has used generations of this device to make a careful series of perceptual measurements of AR phenomena, which have been described in publications over the previous 8 years.  This paper systematically describes the design, assembly, calibration, and measurement of our AR haploscope.  These methods have been developed and improved in our lab over the past 10 years.  Despite the fact that 180 years have elapsed since the original report of Wheatstone's stereoscope, we have not previously found a paper that describes these kinds of details. </p>

A haploscope is an optical system which produces a carefully
controlled virtual image.  Since the development of Wheatstone's 
original stereoscope in 1838, haploscopes have been used to measure 
perceptual properties of human stereoscopic vision.  This paper 
presents an augmented reality (AR) haploscope, which allows the 
viewing of virtual objects superimposed against the real world.  Our 
lab has used generations of this device to make a careful series of 
perceptual measurements of AR phenomena, which have been described in 
publications over the previous 8 years.  This paper systematically 
describes the design, assembly, calibration, and measurement of our AR 
haploscope.  These methods have been developed and improved in our lab 
over the past 10 years.  Despite the fact that 180 years have elapsed 
since the original report of Wheatstone's stereoscope, we have not 
previously found a paper that describes these kinds of details.
