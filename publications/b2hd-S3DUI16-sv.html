<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract">  <p>Augmented Reality (AR) systems, which utilize optical see-through head-mounted displays, are becoming more common place, with several consumer level options already available, and the promise of additional, more advanced, devices on the horizon. A common factor among current generation optical see-through devices, though, is fixed focal distance to virtual content. While fixed focus is not a concern for video see-through AR, since both virtual and real world imagery are combined into a single image by the display, unequal distances between real world objects and the virtual display screen in optical see-through AR is unavoidable.</p> <p>In this work, we investigate the issue of focus blur, in particular, the blurring caused by simultaneously viewing virtual content and physical objects in the environment at differing focal distances. We additionally examine the application of dynamic sharpening filters as a straight forward, system independent, means for mitigating this effect improving the clarity of defocused AR content. We assess the utility of this method, termed SharpView, by employing an adjustment experiment in which users actively apply varying amounts of sharpening to reduce the perception of blur in AR content shown at four focal disparity levels relative to real world imagery.</p> <p>Our experimental results confirm that dynamic correction schemes are required for adequately addressing the presence of blur in Optical See-Through AR. Furthermore, we validate the ability of our SharpView model to improve the perceived visual clarity of focus blurred content, with optimal performance at focal differences well suited for near field AR applications.</p> </p>

&lt;p&gt;Augmented Reality (AR) systems, which utilize optical see-through 
head-mounted displays, are becoming more common place, with several 
consumer level options already available, and the promise of 
additional, more advanced, devices on the horizon. A common factor 
among current generation optical see-through devices, though, is fixed 
focal distance to virtual content. While fixed focus is not a concern 
for video see-through AR, since both virtual and real world imagery 
are combined into a single image by the display, unequal distances 
between real world objects and the virtual display screen in optical 
see-through AR is unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we investigate the issue of focus blur, in 
particular, the blurring caused by simultaneously viewing virtual 
content and physical objects in the environment at differing focal 
distances. We additionally examine the application of dynamic 
sharpening filters as a straight forward, system independent, means 
for mitigating this effect improving the clarity of defocused AR 
content. We assess the utility of this method, termed SharpView, by 
employing an adjustment experiment in which users actively apply 
varying amounts of sharpening to reduce the perception of blur in AR 
content shown at four focal disparity levels relative to real world 
imagery.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Our experimental results confirm that dynamic correction schemes 
are required for adequately addressing the presence of blur in Optical 
See-Through AR. Furthermore, we validate the ability of our SharpView 
model to improve the perceived visual clarity of focus blurred 
content, with optimal performance at focal differences well suited for 
near field AR applications.&lt;/p&gt;
