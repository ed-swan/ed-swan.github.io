  abstract =    { 
We tested users' depth perception of virtual objects in our mobile 
augmented reality (AR) system in both indoor and outdoor environments 
using a depth matching task. The indoor environment 
is characterized by strong linear perspective cues; we attempted to 
re-create these cues in the outdoor environment. In the indoor environment, 
we found an overall pattern of underestimation of depth 
that is typical for virtual environments and AR systems. However, 
in the outdoor environment, we found that subjects overestimated 
depth. In addition, our synthetic linear perspective cues met with 
a measure of success, leading users to reduce their estimate of the 
depth of distant objects. We describe the experimental procedure, 
analyze the data, present the results of the study, and discuss the 
implications for mobile, outdoor AR systems.
