<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract">  The following series of experiments explore the effect of static peripheral stimulation on the perception of distance and spatial scale in a typical head-mounted virtual environment. It was found that applying constant white light in an observerâs far periphery enabled the observer to more accurately judge distances using blind walking. An effect of similar magnitude was also found when observers estimated the size of a virtual space using a visual scale task. The presence of the effect across multiple psychophysical tasks provided confidence that a perceptual change was, in fact, being invoked by the addition of the peripheral stimulation. These results were also compared to observer performance in a very large field of view virtual environment and in the real world. The subsequent findings raise the possibility that distance judgments in virtual environments might be considerably more similar to those in the real world than previous work has suggested. </p>
