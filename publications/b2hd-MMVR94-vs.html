<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract">  At the Ohio Supercomputer Center, and the College of Medicine and the Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design at The Ohio State University, We are developing a a system to provide an intuitive interface for manipulating and experiencing virtual data sets, specifically volume reconstructions of multi-modal medical data. This design requires a minimum of setup time and user calibration. Initial user settings are stored on line, and can be readily modified to accommodate user differences. Our system provides a cost efficient, unencumbered experience with virtual information. We are not attempting to provide a "full immersion into a virtual reality." We do not feel that the technology is fully developed at this time. Our goal is not to convince users that they are somewhere else or actually working on the "real patient." The objective is to provide an improved experience with a reconstructed model to gain new understanding of patient anatomy and the intricacies of medical procedures. Our intent is to provide meaningful cues in the simulator to facilitate rapid association, allowing users to readily assimilate the information and transfer the gained knowledge to actual practice. In addition, the interface minimizes the amount of interactive modifications required by the users, thereby allowing for more user flexibility. </p>
