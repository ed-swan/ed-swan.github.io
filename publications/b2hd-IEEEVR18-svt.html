<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract">  For optical see-through head-mounted displays, the mismatch between a display's focal length and the real world scene inadvertently prevents users from simultaneously focusing on the presented virtual content and the scene. It has been shown that it is possible to ameliorate the out-of-focus blur for images with a known focus distance, by applying an algorithm called SharpView.  However, it remains unclear if SharpView also improves the readability and clarity of text rendered on the display.  In this study, we investigate whether users reported increased text clarity when SharpView was applied to a text label, and how the focal demand of the display, the focal distance to real world content, and gaze condition affect the result.  Our results indicate that, in non-fixated viewing, there is a significant user preference for SharpView-enhanced text strings.</p>

For optical see-through head-mounted displays, the mismatch between a

SharpView also improves the readability and clarity of text rendered
