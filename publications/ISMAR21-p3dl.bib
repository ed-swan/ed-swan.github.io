  abstract =    {
For optical see-through augmented reality (AR), a new method for measuring the 
perceived three-dimensional location of virtual objects is presented, where 
participants verbally report a virtual object's location relative to both a 
vertical and horizontal grid.  The method is tested with a small (1.95 x 1.95 x 
1.95 cm) virtual object at distances of 50 to 80 cm, viewed through a Microsoft 
HoloLens 1st generation AR display.  Two experiments examine two different 
virtual object designs, whether turning in a circle between reported object 
locations disrupts HoloLens tracking, and whether accuracy errors, including a 
rightward bias and underestimated depth, might be due to systematic errors that 
are restricted to a particular display.  Turning in a circle did not disrupt 
HoloLens tracking, and testing with a second display did not suggest systematic 
errors restricted to a particular display.  Instead, the experiments are 
consistent with the hypothesis that, when looking downwards at a horizontal 
plane, HoloLens 1st generation displays exhibit a systematic rightward 
perceptual bias.  Precision analysis suggests that the method could measure the 
perceived location of a virtual object within an accuracy of less than 1 mm.
