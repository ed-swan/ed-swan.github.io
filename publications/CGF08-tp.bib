A perceptual study of four tensor glyphs for symmetric, real, 
traceless tensors was performed. Each glyph encodes three properties 
of the system: Orientation, uniaxiality (alignment along the direction 
of orientation), and biaxiality (alignment along a vector orthogonal 
to the orientation). Thirty users over two studies were asked to 
identify these three properties for each glyph type under a variety of 
permutations in order to evaluate the effectiveness of visually 
communicating the properties; response time was also measured. We 
discuss the significant differences found between the methods as 
guidance to the use of these glyphs for traceless tensor 
visualization.
