  abstract =     { 
With the growing availability of optical see-through (OST) 
head-mounted displays (HMDs), there is a present need for robust, 
uncomplicated, and automatic calibration methods suited for non-expert 
users. This work presents the results of a user study which both 
objectively and subjectively examines registration accuracy produced 
by three OST HMD calibration methods: (1) SPAAM, (2) Degraded SPAAM, 
and (3) Recycled INDICA, a recently developed semi-automatic 
calibration method. Accuracy metrics used for evaluation include 
subject provided quality values and error between perceived and 
absolute registration coordinates. Our results show all three 
calibration methods produce very accurate registration in the 
horizontal direction but caused subjects to perceive the distance of 
virtual objects to be closer than intended. Surprisingly, the 
semi-automatic calibration method produced more accurate registration 
vertically and in perceived object distance overall. User assessed 
quality values were also the highest for Recycled INDICA, particularly 
when objects were shown at distance. The results of this study confirm 
that Recycled INDICA is capable of producing equal or superior 
on-screen registration compared to common OST HMD calibration 
methods. We also identify a potential hazard in using reprojection 
error as a quantitative analysis technique to predict registration 
accuracy. We conclude with discussing the further need for examining 
INDICA calibration in binocular HMD systems, and the present 
possibility for creation of a closed-loop continuous calibration 
method for OST Augmented Reality.
