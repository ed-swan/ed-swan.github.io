<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract"> Many augmented reality (AR) applications require observers to shift their gaze between AR and real-world content.  To date, commercial optical see-through (OST) AR displays have presented content at either a single focal distance, or at a small number of fixed focal distances.  Meanwhile, real-world stimuli can occur at a variety of focal distances.  Therefore, when shifting gaze between AR and real-world content, in order to view new content in sharp focus, observers must often change their eye's accommodative state.  When performed repetitively, this can negatively affect task performance and eye fatigue.  However, these effects may be under reported, because past research has not yet considered the potential additional effect of distracting real world backgrounds. An experimental method that analyzes background effects is presented, using a text-based visual search task that requires integrating information presented in both AR and the real world.  An experiment is reported, which examined the effect of a distracting background versus a blank background, at focal switching distances of 0, 1.33, 2.0, and 3.33 meters.  Qualitatively, a majority of the participants reported that the distracting background made the task more difficult and fatiguing.  Quantitatively, increasing the focal switching distance resulted in reduced task performance and increased eye fatigue. However, changing the background, between blank and distracting, did not result in significant measured differences. Suggestions are given for further efforts to examine background effects. </p>

Many augmented reality (AR) applications require observers to shift

stimuli can occur at a variety of focal distances.  Therefore, when shifting
