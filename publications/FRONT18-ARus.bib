  abstract =     {
Augmented Reality (AR) interfaces have been studied extensively over 
the last few decades, with a growing number of user-based 
experiments. In this paper, we systematically review 10 years of the 
most influential AR user studies, from 2005 to 2014. A total of 291 
papers with 369 individual user studies have been reviewed and 
classified based on their application areas. The primary contribution 
of the review is to present the broad landscape of user-based AR 
research, and to provide a high-level view of how that landscape has 
changed. We summarize the high-level contributions from each category 
of papers, and present examples of the most influential user 
studies. We also identify areas where there have been few user 
studies, and opportunities for future research. Among other things, we 
find that there is a growing trend toward handheld AR user studies, 
and that most studies are conducted in laboratory settings and do not 
involve pilot testing. This research will be useful for AR researchers 
who want to follow best practices in designing their own AR user 
studies.
