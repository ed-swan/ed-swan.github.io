In an optical see-through augmented reality system, virtual and real information 
can be viewed at different distances. This requires users to frequently change 
their eye focus from one distance to another, and only one piece of information 
is in sharp focus while the other is out of focus. Previous studies have found 
that due to out-of-focus virtual information, when integrating information 
between the distances, users suffer fatigue and miss important 
information. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel font, termed a SharpView 
font, which looks sharper and more legible than standard fonts when seen out of 
focus. Our method models out-of-focus blur with Zernike polynomials and 
coefficients, develops a focus correction algorithm based on constrained total 
variation optimization, and proposes a novel gradient-based algorithm to 
quantify the sharpness of textual information. We have evaluated the SharpView 
font through simulation and optically viewed camera-based measurement. When seen 
out of focus, our proposed font are significantly sharper than standard fonts, 
as assessed both visually and quantitatively through simulation (40%-44%), as 
well as the optics of an augmented reality display (24%-32%).
