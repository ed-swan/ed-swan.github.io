In this position paper, we consider the issue of developing a flexible 
software architecture which will allow multiple interaction techniques 
to operate simultaneously and in parallel with one another. We 
describe a set of interaction techniques, identify their architectural 
requirements, and consider methods for prioritizing different 
techniques and arbitrating between them when they have conflicting 
objectives. The discussion is made within the context of a mobile 
augmented reality (AR) system for urban situation awareness.
