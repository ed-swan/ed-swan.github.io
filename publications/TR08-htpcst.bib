The integration of automated statistical analysis capabilities with a highly 
interactive, multivariate visualization interface is presented in this 
paper. Innovative visual interaction techniques such as dynamic axis scaling, 
conjunctive parallel coordinates, statistical indicators, and aerial perspective 
shading are exploited to enhance the utility of classical parallel coordinate 
plots.  Moreover, the system facilitates statistical processes such as stepwise 
regression and correlation analysis to assist in the identification and 
quantification of the most significant predictors for a particular dependent 
variable. These capabilities are combined into a unique visualization system 
that is demonstrated via a North Atlantic hurricane climate study using a 
systematic workflow.  This research corroborates the notion that enhanced 
parallel coordinates coupled with statistical analysis can be used for more 
effective knowledge discovery and confirmation in complex, real-world data sets.
