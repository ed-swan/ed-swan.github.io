Highly anticipated consumer level optical see-through head-mounted 
display offerings, such as the Microsoft HoloLens and Epson Moverio 
Pro BT-2000, include not only the standard IMU and GPS sensors common 
to modern mobile devices, but also feature additional depth sensing 
and hand tracking cameras intended to support and promote the 
development of innovative user interaction experiences. Through this 
demonstration, we showcase the potential of these technologies in 
facilitating not only interaction, but also intuitive user-centric 
calibration, for optical see-through augmented reality. Additionally, 
our hardware configuration provides a straightforward example for 
combining consumer level sensors, such as the Leap Motion controller, 
with existing head-mounted displays and secondary tracking devices to 
ease the development and deployment of immersive stereoscopic 
experiences. We believe that the methodologies presented within our 
demonstration not only illustrate the potential for ubiquitous 
calibration across next generation consumer devices, but will also 
inspire and encourage further developmental efforts for optical 
see-through augmented reality from the community at large.
