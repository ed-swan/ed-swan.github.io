  abstract =    { 
We describe a first experiment in evaluating the system capabilities of the 
Battlefield Augmented Reality System, an interactive system designed to 
present military information to dismounted warfighters.  We describe not 
just the current experiment, but a methodology of both system evaluation and 
user performance measurement in the system, and show how both types of tests 
will be useful in system development.  We summarize results in a perceptual 
experiment being used to inform system design, and discuss ongoing and 
future experiments to which the work described herein leads.
