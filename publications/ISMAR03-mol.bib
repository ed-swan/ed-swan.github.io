A useful function of augmented reality (AR) systems is their ability 
to visualize occluded infrastructure directly in a user's view of the 
environment.  This is especially important for our application 
context, which utilizes mobile AR for navigation and other operations 
in an urban environment.  A key problem in the AR field is how to best 
depict occluded objects in such a way that the viewer can correctly 
infer the depth relationships between different physical and virtual 
objects.  Showing a single occluded object with no depth context 
presents an ambiguous picture to the user.  But showing all occluded 
objects in the environments leads to the "Superman's X-ray vision" 
problem, in which the user sees too much information to make sense of 
the depth relationships of objects. 
Our efforts differ qualitatively from previous work in AR occlusion, 
because our application domain involves <em>far-field</em> occluded 
objects, which are tens of meters distant from the user.  Previous 
work has focused on <em>near-field</em> occluded objects, which are within 
or just beyond arm's reach, and which use different perceptual cues. 
We designed and evaluated a number of sets of display attributes.  We 
then conducted a user study to determine which representations best 
express occlusion relationships among far-field objects.  We identify 
a drawing style and opacity settings that enable the user to 
accurately interpret three layers of occluded objects, even in the 
absence of perspective constraints.
