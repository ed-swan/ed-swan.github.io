This paper presents a 2D flow visualization user study that we conducted to 
evaluate particular geometry-based and texture-based techniques, namely, 
grid-based variable-size arrows, evenly spaced streamlines, and LIC variants 
(basic, oriented, and enhanced versions) coupled with a colorwheel and/or 
rainbow color map. To reduce data-related bias, templatebased explicit flow 
synthesis was adopted for creating a wide variety of symmetric flows with 
similar topological complexity. To suppress task-related bias, pattern-based 
implicit task design was employed, addressing critical point recognition, 
critical point classification (saddle, center, focus), and symmetric pattern 
categorization (x-axis/y-axis/center symmetry). In addition, variableduration 
and fixed-duration measurement mechanisms were utilized for lightweight 
precision-critical and heavyweight judgmentintensive flow analysis tasks, 
respectively, to record visualization effectiveness. These anti-bias approaches 
allowed us to obtain as convincing results as possible from the user study. Our 
study shows that a texture-based dense representation with accentuated flow 
streaks, such as enhanced LIC, enables intuitive perception of the flow, while a 
geometry-based integral representation with uniform density control, such as 
evenly spaced streamlines, may exploit visual interpolation to facilitate mental 
reconstruction of the flow. It is also shown that inappropriate color mapping 
(e.g., colorwheel) may add distractions to a flow representation.
