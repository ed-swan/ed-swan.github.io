<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract"> Optical see-through head-mounted displays (OST HMDs) are a majoroutput medium for Augmented Reality, which have seen significantgrowth in popularity and usage among the general public due to thegrowing release of consumer-oriented models, such as the MicrosoftHololens. Unlike Virtual Reality headsets, OST HMDs inherently supportthe addition of computer-generated graphics directly into the lightpath between a userâs eyes and their view of the physical world. Aswith most Augmented and Virtual Reality systems, the physical positionof an OST HMD is typically determined by an external or embedded6-Degree-of-Freedom tracking system. However, in order to properlyrender virtual objects, which are perceived as spatially aligned withthe physical environment, it is also necessary to accurately measurethe position of the userâs eyes within the tracking systemâscoordinate frame. For over 20 years, researchers have proposed variouscalibration methods to determine this needed eye position. However, todate, there has not been a comprehensive overview of these proceduresand their requirements. Hence, this paper surveys the field ofcalibration methods for OST HMDs.

Optical see-through head-mounted displays (OST HMDs) are a major
output medium for Augmented Reality, which have seen significant
growth in popularity and usage among the general public due to the
growing release of consumer-oriented models, such as the Microsoft
Hololens. Unlike Virtual Reality headsets, OST HMDs inherently support
the addition of computer-generated graphics directly into the light
path between a userâs eyes and their view of the physical world. As
with most Augmented and Virtual Reality systems, the physical position
of an OST HMD is typically determined by an external or embedded
6-Degree-of-Freedom tracking system. However, in order to properly
render virtual objects, which are perceived as spatially aligned with
the physical environment, it is also necessary to accurately measure
the position of the userâs eyes within the tracking systemâs
coordinate frame. For over 20 years, researchers have proposed various
calibration methods to determine this needed eye position. However, to
date, there has not been a comprehensive overview of these procedures
and their requirements. Hence, this paper surveys the field of
calibration methods for OST HMDs. Specifically, it provides insights
into the fundamentals of calibration techniques, and presents an
overview of both manual and automatic approaches, as well as
evaluation methods and metrics. Finally, it also identifies
opportunities for future research.
