We evaluate a dozen prevailing graph-sampling techniques with an
ultimate goal to better visualize and understand big and complex
graphs that exhibit different properties and structures. The
evaluation uses eight benchmark datasets with four different graph
types collected from Stanford Network Analysis Platform and NetworkX
to give a comprehensive comparison of various types of graphs. The
study provides a practical guideline for visualizing big graphs of
different sizes and structures. The paper discusses results and
important observations from the study.
