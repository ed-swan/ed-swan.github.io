Augmented reality (AR) systems present a mixture of virtual and real 
objects. The challenge for AR system evaluators is how to tell whether 
the virtual world is effective at conveying the sense of reality. 
Itmay never be possible or even necessary to determine whether the 
user is truly fooled in all situations or is merely "suspending 
disbelief," but one can objectively measure the effectiveness of an AR 
environment with a task-based approach. We present the results of our 
first such experiment, involving low-level perceptual tasks of 
recognition and depth matching.
