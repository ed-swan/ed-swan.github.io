      <p>Dr. <em>J. Edward Swan II</em> is a Professor of Computer Science and
      Engineering, and an Adjunct Professor of Psychology, at Mississippi State
      University.&nbsp; He holds a B.S. (1988) in computer science from Auburn
      University and M.S. (1992) and Ph.D. (1997) degrees in computer science
      from Ohio State University, where he studied computer graphics and
      human-computer interaction.&nbsp; Before joining Mississippi State
      University in 2004, Dr.&nbsp;Swan spent seven years as a scientist at the
      Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C.&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp;Swan's
      research has been broad-based, centering on the topics of virtual and
      augmented reality, computer graphics, empirical methods, visualization,
      human-computer interaction, and human factors.&nbsp; Currently,
      Dr.&nbsp;Swan is studying human-factors aspects of augmented and virtual
      reality, with a particular focus on the perception of depth and layout,
      as well as empirical techniques for evaluating and validating
      visualizations.&nbsp; He has organized and taught 13 professional
      tutorials at IEEE Virtual Reality, IEEE Visualization, and ACM
      SIGGRAPH.&nbsp; His research has been funded by the National Science
      Foundation, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Naval
      Research Laboratory, and the Office of Naval Research.&nbsp;
      Dr.&nbsp;Swan is a member of ACM, IEEE, and the IEEE Computer
      Society. </p>
