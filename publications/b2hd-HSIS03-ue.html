<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract">  Usability engineering is a cost-effective, user-centered process that ensures a high level of effectiveness, efficiency, and safety in complex interactive systems.  This paper presents a brief description of usability engineering activities, and discusses our experiences with leading usability engineering activities for three very different types of interactive applications: a responsive workbench-based command and control application called Dragon, a wearable augmented reality application for urban warfare called Battlefield Augmented Reality System (BARS), and a head-mounted hardware device, called Nomad, for dismounted soldiers.  For each application, we present our approach to usability engineering, how we tailored the usability engineering process and methods to address application-specific needs, and give results. </p>

Usability engineering is a cost-effective, user-centered process that ensures a 
high level of effectiveness, efficiency, and safety in complex interactive 
systems.  This paper presents a brief description of usability engineering 
activities, and discusses our experiences with leading usability engineering 
activities for three very different types of interactive applications: a 
responsive workbench-based command and control application called Dragon, a 
wearable augmented reality application for urban warfare called Battlefield 
Augmented Reality System (BARS), and a head-mounted hardware device, called 
Nomad, for dismounted soldiers.  For each application, we present our approach 
to usability engineering, how we tailored the usability engineering process and 
methods to address application-specific needs, and give results.
