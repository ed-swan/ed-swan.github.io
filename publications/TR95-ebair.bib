Reconstruction is imperative whenever an image needs to be resampled as a result 
of transformation such as an affine or perspective transform, or texture 
mapping. We present a new method for the characterization and measurement of 
reconstruction error. Our method, based on spatial domain error analysis, uses 
approximation theory to develop error bounds. We provide, for the first time, an 
efficient way to guarantee an error bound at every point by varying filter 
size. We go further to support position-adaptive and data-adaptive 
reconstruction which adjust filter size to the location of reconstruction and 
the data in its vicinity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with 
1D and 2D examples.
