It is well-documented that natural lighting conditions and real-world 
backgrounds affect the usability of optical see-through augmented 
reality (AR) displays in outdoor environments.  In many cases, outdoor 
environmental conditions can dramatically alter users' color 
perception of user interface elements, by for example, washing out 
text or icon colors.  As a result, users' semantic interpretation of 
interface elements can be compromised, rendering interface designs 
useless or counter-productive - an especially critical problem in 
application domains where color encoding is critical, such as military 
or medical visualization. 
In this paper, we present our experiences designing and con-structing 
an optical AR testbed that emulates outdoor lighting conditions and 
allows us to measure the combined color of real-world backgrounds and 
virtual colors as projected through an optical see-through display. 
We present a formalization of color blending in AR, which supports 
further research on perceived color in AR displays.  We describe an 
engineering study where we measure the color of light that reaches an 
optical see-through display user's eye under systematically varied 
virtual and real-world conditions.  Our results further quantify the 
effect of lighting and background color on the color of virtual 
graphics, and specifically quantify how virtual colors change based on 
different real-world backgrounds.
