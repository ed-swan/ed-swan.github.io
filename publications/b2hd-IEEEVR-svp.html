<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract">  A common factor among current generation optical see-through augmented reality systems is fixed focal distance to virtual content. In this work, we investigate the issue of focus blur, in particular, the blurring caused by simultaneously viewing virtual content and physical objects in the environment at differing focal distances. We examine the application of dynamic sharpening filters as a straight forward, system independent, means for mitigating this effect improving the clarity of defocused AR content. We assess the utility of this method, termed SharpView, by employing an adjustment experiment in which users actively apply varying amounts of sharpening to reduce the perception of blur in AR content. Our experimental results validate the ability of our SharpView model to improve the visual clarity of focus blurred content, with optimal performance at focal differences well suited for near field AR applications. </p>
