At the Ohio Supercomputer Center, and the College of Medicine and the Advanced 
Computing Center for the Arts and Design at The Ohio State University, We are 
developing a a system to provide an intuitive interface for manipulating and 
experiencing virtual data sets, specifically volume reconstructions of 
multi-modal medical data. This design requires a minimum of setup time and user 
calibration. Initial user settings are stored on line, and can be readily 
modified to accommodate user differences. 
Our system provides a cost efficient, unencumbered experience with virtual 
information. We are not attempting to provide a "full immersion into a virtual 
reality." We do not feel that the technology is fully developed at this 
time. Our goal is not to convince users that they are somewhere else or actually 
working on the "real patient." The objective is to provide an improved 
experience with a reconstructed model to gain new understanding of patient 
anatomy and the intricacies of medical procedures. Our intent is to provide 
meaningful cues in the simulator to facilitate rapid association, allowing users 
to readily assimilate the information and transfer the gained knowledge to 
actual practice. In addition, the interface minimizes the amount of interactive 
modifications required by the users, thereby allowing for more user flexibility.
