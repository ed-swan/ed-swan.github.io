Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) models simulate weather 
conditions by generating 2D numerical weather prediction ensemble 
members either through perturbing initial conditions or by changing 
different parameterization schemes, e.g., cumulus and microphysics 
schemes. These simulations are often used by weather analysts to 
analyze the nature of uncertainty attributed by these simulations to 
forecast weather conditions with good accuracy. The number of 
simulations used for forecasting is growing with the advent of 
increase in computing power. Hence, there is a need for providing 
better visual insights of uncertainty with growing number of ensemble 
members. We propose a geo-visual analytical framework that uses visual 
analytics approach to resolve visual scalability of these ensemble 
members. Our approach naturally fits with the workflow of an analyst 
analyzing ensemble spatial uncertainty. Meteorologists evaluated our 
framework qualitatively and found it to be effective in acquiring 
insights of spatial uncertainty associated with multiple ensemble runs 
that are simulated using multiple parameterization schemes.
