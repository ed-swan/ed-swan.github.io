<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract"> Accurate and usable x-ray vision is a significant goal in augmented reality (AR)development.  X-ray vision, or the ability to comprehend location and object information when it is presented through an opaque barrier, needs to successfully convey scene information to be a viable use case for AR.  Further, this investigation should be performed in an ecologically valid context in order to best test x-ray vision.  This research seeks to experimentally evaluate the perceived object location of stimuli presented with x-ray vision, as compared to real-world perceived object location through a window, at action space distances of 1.5 to 15 meters. </p>

Accurate and usable x-ray vision is a significant goal in augmented reality (AR)

this investigation should be performed in an ecologically valid context in order
