A highly interactive visual analysis system is presented that is 
based on an enhanced variant of parallel coordinates -- a multivariate 
information visualization technique.  The system combines 
many variations of previously described visual interaction 
techniques such as dynamic axis scaling, conjunctive visual queries, 
statistical indicators, and aerial perspective shading. 
The system capabilities are demonstrated on a hurricane climate data set. 
This climate study corroborates the notion that enhanced visual 
analysis with parallel coordinates provides a deeper understanding 
when used in conjunction with traditional multiple regression analysis.
