<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract"> For optical see-through augmented reality (AR), a new method for measuring the perceived three-dimensional location of virtual objects is presented, where participants verbally report a virtual object's location relative to both a vertical and horizontal grid.  The method is tested with a small (1.95 x 1.95 x 1.95 cm) virtual object at distances of 50 to 80 cm, viewed through a Microsoft HoloLens 1st generation AR display.  Two experiments examine two different virtual object designs, whether turning in a circle between reported object locations disrupts HoloLens tracking, and whether accuracy errors, including a rightward bias and underestimated depth, might be due to systematic errors that are restricted to a particular display.  Turning in a circle did not disrupt HoloLens tracking, and testing with a second display did not suggest systematic errors restricted to a particular display.  Instead, the experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that, when looking downwards at a horizontal plane, HoloLens 1st generation displays exhibit a systematic rightward perceptual bias.  Precision analysis suggests that the method could measure the perceived location of a virtual object within an accuracy of less than 1 mm. </p>
