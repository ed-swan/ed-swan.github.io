The use of Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Displays (OST-HMDs) for 
presenting Augmented Reality experiences has become more common, due 
to the increasing availability of lower cost head-worn device options. 
Despite this growth, commercially available OST hardware remains 
devoid of the integrated eye-tracking cameras necessary for 
automatically calibrating user-specific view parameters, leaving 
manual calibration methods as the most consistently viable option 
across display types.  The Single Point Active Alignment Method 
(SPAAM) is currently the most-cited manual calibration technique, due 
to the relaxation of user constraints with respect to allowable motion 
during the calibration process.  This work presents the first formal 
study directly investigating the effects that alignment point 
distribution imposes on SPAAM calibration accuracy and precision. A 
user experiment, employing a single expert user, is presented, in 
which SPAAM calibrations are performed under each of five conditions. 
Four of the conditions cross alignment distance (arm length, room 
scale) with user pose (sitting, standing).  The fifth condition is a 
control condition, in which the user is replaced with a rigidly 
mounted camera; the control condition removes the effect of noise from 
uncontrollable postural sway.  The final experimental results show no 
significant impact on calibration due to user pose (sitting, 
standing).  The control condition also did not differ from the user 
produced calibration results, suggesting that posture sway was not a 
significant factor.  However, both the user and control conditions 
show significant improvement using arm's length alignment points over 
room scale alignments, with an order of magnitude difference in eye 
location estimate error between conditions.
