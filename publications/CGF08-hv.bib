We present the results from a user study looking at the ability of observers to 
mentally integrate wind direction and magnitude over a vector field.  The data 
set chosen for the study is an MM5 (PSU/NCAR Mesoscale Model) simulation of 
Hurricane Lili over the Gulf of Mexico as it approaches the southeastern United 
States. Nine observers participated in the study.  This study investigates the 
effect of layering on the observer's ability to determine the magnitude and 
direction of a vector field.  We found a tendency for observers to underestimate 
the magnitude of the vectors and a counter-clockwise bias when determining the 
average direction of a vector field. We completed an additional study with two 
observers to try to uncover the source of the counter-clockwise bias.  These 
results have direct implications to atmospheric scientists, but may also be able 
to be applied to other fields that use 2D vector fields.
