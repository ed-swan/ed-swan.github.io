  abstract =    {
Augmented Reality (AR) interfaces have been studied extensively over 
the last few decades, with a growing number of user-based 
experiments. In this paper, we systematically review most AR papers 
published between 2005 and 2014 that include user studies. A total of 
291 papers have been reviewed and classified based on their 
application areas. The primary contribution of the review is to 
present the broad landscape of user-based AR research, and to provide 
a high-level view of how that landscape has changed. We also identify 
areas where there have been few user studies, and opportunities for 
future research. This poster describes the methodology of the review 
and the classifications of AR research that have emerged.
