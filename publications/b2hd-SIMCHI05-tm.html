<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract">  Mobile augmented reality (AR) combines 3D spatially registered graphics and sounds with a user's perception of the real world. Combining mobile AR with computer simulation promises to revolutionize practicing and training for many tasks, especially those that are naturally conducted in the real world. However, to achieve this potential, the field needs a much better understanding of how users perceive and comprehend information that is mediated by an AR display. We review the work that has been performed in this area to date and discuss the challenges presented by perceptual issues in AR for training systems. Then we describe our application of experimental methodologies which address perceptual and cognitive issues, employs subject matter experts to ensure domain relevance, and address the limitations of emerging technology. We apply these methodologies in the context of a mobile AR simulation system that we have developed to support military training. </p>
