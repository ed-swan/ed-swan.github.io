  abstract =     {
In augmented reality (AR) environments, information is often
distributed between real- world and virtual contexts, and often 
appears at different distances from the user. Therefore, to integrate 
the information, users must repeatedly switch context and refocus the 
eyes. To focus at different distances, the user's eyes must 
accommodate, which when done repeatedly can cause eyestrain and 
degrade task performance. An experiment was conducted that examined 
switching context and focal distance between a real and an AR 
environment, using a text-based visual search task and a monocular 
optical see-through AR display. Both context switching and focal 
distance switching resulted in significantly reduced performance. In 
addition, repeatedly performing the task caused visual fatigue to 
steadily increase. Performance was particularly poor for virtual text 
presented at optical infinity, and for target letters that 
participants tried to read before their eyes had completely 
accommodated to a new focal distance. The results show that context 
switching and focal distance switching are important AR user interface 
design issues.
