Accurate and usable x-ray vision is a significant goal in augmented reality (AR)
development.  X-ray vision, or the ability to comprehend location and object 
information when it is presented through an opaque barrier, needs to 
successfully convey scene information to be a viable use case for AR.  Further, 
this investigation should be performed in an ecologically valid context in order 
to best test x-ray vision.  This research seeks to experimentally evaluate the 
perceived object location of stimuli presented with x-ray vision, as compared to 
real-world perceived object location through a window, at action space distances 
of 1.5 to 15 meters.
