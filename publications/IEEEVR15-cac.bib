  abstract =    { 
The current advent of consumer level optical see-through (OST) 
head-mounted displays (HMD’s) has greatly broadened the accessibility 
of Augmented Reality (AR) to not only researchers but also the general 
public as well. This increased user base heightens the need for robust 
automatic calibration mechanisms suited for non- technical users. We 
are developing a fully automated calibration system for two stereo OST 
HMD’s, a consumer level and prototype model, based on the recently 
introduced interaction free display calibration (INDICA) method. Our 
current efforts are also focused on the development of an evaluation 
process to assess the performance of the system during use by 
non-expert subjects.
