A fundamental problem in optical, see-through augmented reality (AR) is 
characterizing how it affects human depth perception.  This problem is 
important, because AR system developers need to both place graphics in arbitrary 
spatial relationships with real-world objects, and to know that users will 
perceive them in the same relationships.  However, achieving this is difficult, 
because the graphics are physically drawn directly in front of the eyes. 
Furthermore, AR makes possible enhanced perceptual techniques that have no 
real-world equivalent, such as x-ray vision, where AR users perceive that 
graphics are located behind opaque surfaces.  Also, to date AR depth perception 
research has examined near-field distances, yet many compelling AR applications 
operate at longer distances, and human depth perception itself operates 
differently at medium-field and far-field distances. 
This paper describes the first medium- and far-field AR depth perception 
experiment that provides metric results.  We describe a task and experimental 
design that measures AR depth perception, with strong linear perspective depth 
cues, and matches results found in the general depth perception literature.  Our 
experiment quantifies how depth estimation error grows with increasing distance 
across a range of medium- to far-field distances, and we also find evidence for 
a switch in bias from underestimating to overestimating depth at ~19.4 meters. 
Our experiment also examined the x-ray vision condition, and found initial 
evidence of how depth estimation error grows for occluded versus non-occluded 
graphics.
