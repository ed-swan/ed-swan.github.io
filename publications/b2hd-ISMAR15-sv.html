<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract">  Augmented Reality (AR) makes it possible to insert computer generated information and objects onto a userâs view of the real-world. Optical See-Through (OST) Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) are becoming an increasingly common medium for presenting AR content, with the added benefit of enabling users to observe the real-world directly, through transparent display material, alongside computer graphics (CG) content. A problem in OST HMD systems, though, is the existence of focal rivalry resulting from the distance disparity between real world objects and the virtual screen of the HMD. Due to the focal limitations of the human eye, this focal discrepancy results in the CG image appearing blurred when real objects are fixated upon. The goal of our SharpView system is to ameliorate this problem through sharpening. SharpView utilizes a variable sharpening filter, based on the eye's Point Spread Function (PSF), to process the CG imagery before it is displayed. We derive the PSF from three parameters in real-time: pupil size, fixation distance, and the focal distance of the virtual display screen. Our demonstration allows users to experience the focal disparity problem in OST HMD hardware and view the improved legibility of CG content provided by the SharpView technique. </p>
