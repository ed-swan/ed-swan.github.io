A current goal in volume graphics is a volume rendering algorithm that provides 
an elegant and controllable tradeoff between image quality and rendering speed. 
In this report we propose a slice-based volume rendering algorithm which 
attempts to address this goal.  We describe both the basic algorithm and several 
ways that it can operate in an incremental and an adaptive manner.
