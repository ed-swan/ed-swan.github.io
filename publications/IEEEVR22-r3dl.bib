  abstract =    {
An important research question in optical see-through (OST) augmented reality
(AR) is, how accurately and precisely can a virtual object's real world location 
be perceived? Previously, a method was developed to measure the perceived 
three-dimensional location of virtual objects in OST AR. In this research, a 
replication study is reported, which examined whether the perceived location of 
virtual objects are biased in the direction of the dominant eye. The successful 
replication analysis suggests that perceptual accuracy is not biased in the 
direction of the dominant eye. Compared to the previous study's findings, 
overall perceptual accuracy increased, and precision was similar.
