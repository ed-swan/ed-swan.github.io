  abstract =    { 
In this paper we describe a system that allows a power wheelchair user to drive 
through a virtual architectural environment. The system allows architects and 
designers to visualize an environment, test the environment for handicapped 
accessibility, and determine whether the environment meets design standards such 
as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. First we describe the system 
itself, including its hardware and software components and its user 
interface. Then we discuss architectural and design considerations.
