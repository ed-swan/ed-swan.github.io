An enhanced interactive variant of the parallel coordinates visualization 
technique is presented.  An example of its capabilities is demonstrated on a 
hurricane climate dataset.  Its capabilities include focus+context filtering, 
dynamic visual queries with sliders, statistical displays, relocatable axes, 
axis inversion, details-on-demand, a pop-up menu interface, and aerial 
perspective shading. Furthermore, parallel coordinates can visually depict the 
same correlations that weather scientists find meaningful. It is demonstrated 
that these interactive parallel coordinates enhancements provide a deeper 
understanding when used in conjunction with traditional multiple regression 
analysis.
