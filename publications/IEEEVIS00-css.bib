This paper describes a computer modeling and simulation system that supports 
<em>computational steering</em>, which is an effort to make the typical simulation 
workflow more efficient.  Our system provides an interface that allows 
scientists to perform all of the steps in the simulation process in parallel and 
online.  It uses a standard network flow visualization package, which has been 
extended to display graphical output in an immersive virtual environment such as 
a CAVE.  Our system allows scientists to interactively manipulate simulation 
parameters and observe the results.  It also supports <em>inverse steering</em>, 
where the user specifies the desired simulation result, and the system searches 
for the simulation parameters that achieve this result.  Taken together, these 
capabilities allow scientists to more efficiently and effectively understand 
model behavior, as well as to search through simulation parameter space. 
This paper is also a case study of applying our system to the problem of 
simulating microwave interactions with missile bodies.  Because these 
interactions are difficult to study experimentally, and have important effects 
on missile electronics, there is a strong desire to develop and validate 
simulation models of this phenomena.
