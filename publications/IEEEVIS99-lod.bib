We present a new rendering technique, termed <em>LOD-sprite</em> rendering, 
which uses a combination of a level-of-detail (LOD) representation of the scene 
together with reusing image <em>sprites</em> (previously rendered images).  Our 
primary application is accelerating terrain rendering.  The LOD-sprite technique 
renders an initial frame using a high-resolution model of the scene geometry. 
It renders subsequent frames with a much lower-resolution model of the scene 
geometry and texture-maps each polygon with the image sprite from the initial 
high-resolution frame.  As it renders these subsequent frames the technique 
measures the error associated with the divergence of the view position from the 
position where the initial frame was rendered.  Once this error exceeds a 
user-defined threshold, the technique re-renders the scene from the 
high-resolution model.  We have efficiently implemented the LOD-sprite technique 
with texture-mapping graphics hardware.  Although to date we have only applied 
LOD-sprite to terrain rendering, it could easily be extended to other 
applications.  We feel LOD-sprite holds particular promise for real-time 
rendering systems.
