How do users of virtual environments perceive virtual space?  Many experiments 
have explored this question, but most of these have used head-mounted 
immersive displays.  This paper reports an experiment that studied 
large-screen immersive displays at medium-field distances of 2 to 15 meters. 
The experiment measured egocentric depth judgments in a CAVE, a tiled display 
wall, and a real-world outdoor field as a control condition.  We carefully 
modeled the outdoor field to make the three environments as similar as 
possible.  Measuring egocentric depth judgments in large-screen immersive 
displays requires adapting new measurement protocols; the experiment used 
timed imagined walking, verbal estimation, and triangulated blind walking. 
We found that depth judgments from timed imagined walking and verbal 
estimation were very similar in all three environments.  However, triangulated 
blind walking was accurate only in the outdoor field; in the large-screen 
immersive displays it showed underestimation effects that were likely caused 
by insufficient physical space to perform the technique.  These results 
suggest using timed imagined walking as a primary protocol for assessing depth 
perception in large-screen immersive displays.  We also found that depth 
judgments in the CAVE were more accurate than in the tiled display wall, which 
suggests that the peripheral scenery offered by the CAVE is helpful when 
perceiving virtual space.
