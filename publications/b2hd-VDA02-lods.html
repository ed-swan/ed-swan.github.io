<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract">  A stable frame rate is important for interactive rendering systems. Image-based modeling and rendering (IBMR) techniques, which model parts of the scene with image sprites, are a promising technique for interactive systems because they allow the sprite to be manipulated instead of the underlying scene geometry.  However, with IBMR techniques a frequent problem is an unstable frame rate, because generating an image sprite (with 3D rendering) is time-consuming relative to manipulating the sprite (with 2D image resampling).  This paper describes one solution to this problem, by distributing an IBMR technique into a collection of cooperating threads and executable programs across two computers. The particular IBMR technique distributed here is the LOD-Sprite algorithm.  This technique uses a multiple level-of-detail (LOD) scene representation.  It first renders a keyframe from a high-LOD representation, and then caches the frame as an image sprite.  It renders subsequent spriteframes by texture-mapping the cached image sprite into a lower-LOD representation.  We describe a distributed architecture and implementation of LOD-Sprite, in the context of terrain rendering, which takes advantage of graphics hardware.  We present timing results which indicate we have achieved a stable frame rate.  In addition to LOD-Sprite, our distribution method holds promise for other IBMR techniques. </p>

A stable frame rate is important for interactive rendering systems. 
Image-based modeling and rendering (IBMR) techniques, which model 
parts of the scene with image sprites, are a promising technique for 
interactive systems because they allow the sprite to be manipulated 
instead of the underlying scene geometry.  However, with IBMR 
techniques a frequent problem is an unstable frame rate, because 
generating an image sprite (with 3D rendering) is time-consuming 
relative to manipulating the sprite (with 2D image resampling).  This 
paper describes one solution to this problem, by distributing an IBMR 
technique into a collection of cooperating threads and executable 
programs across two computers. 
The particular IBMR technique distributed here is the LOD-Sprite 
algorithm.  This technique uses a multiple level-of-detail (LOD) scene 
representation.  It first renders a keyframe from a high-LOD 
representation, and then caches the frame as an image sprite.  It 
renders subsequent spriteframes by texture-mapping the cached image 
sprite into a lower-LOD representation.  We describe a distributed 
architecture and implementation of LOD-Sprite, in the context of 
terrain rendering, which takes advantage of graphics hardware.  We 
present timing results which indicate we have achieved a stable frame 
rate.  In addition to LOD-Sprite, our distribution method holds 
promise for other IBMR techniques.
