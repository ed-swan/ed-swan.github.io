<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract">  In previous papers, a novel haploscope-based AR environment was implemented [1, 3]. In that system, a participant looks through a set of reflective lenses onto a real-world environment. However, at the same time, there are monitors to the side displaying a virtual object. This object is reflected onto the lenses and is thus, from the viewpoint of the participant, overlaid onto the real environment. In Hua [1], some initial work was done designing a calibration procedure for this haploscope-based AR environment. The current work seeks to modify and expand Huaâs original calibration procedure to make it both more effective and more efficient. As part of developing this new calibration procedure, this paper examines potential sources of error and recommends processes and steps for reducing or eliminating these potential error sources. </p>
