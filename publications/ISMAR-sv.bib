Augmented Reality (AR) makes it possible to insert computer generated 
information and objects onto a userâ€™s view of the real-world. Optical 
See-Through (OST) Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) are becoming an 
increasingly common medium for presenting AR content, with the added 
benefit of enabling users to observe the real-world directly, through 
transparent display material, alongside computer graphics (CG) 
content. A problem in OST HMD systems, though, is the existence of 
focal rivalry resulting from the distance disparity between real world 
objects and the virtual screen of the HMD. Due to the focal 
limitations of the human eye, this focal discrepancy results in the CG 
image appearing blurred when real objects are fixated upon. The goal 
of our SharpView system is to ameliorate this problem through 
sharpening. 
SharpView utilizes a variable sharpening filter, based on the eye's 
Point Spread Function (PSF), to process the CG imagery before it is 
displayed. We derive the PSF from three parameters in real-time: pupil 
size, fixation distance, and the focal distance of the virtual display 
screen. Our demonstration allows users to experience the focal 
disparity problem in OST HMD hardware and view the improved legibility 
of CG content provided by the SharpView technique.
