Most augmented reality (AR) research is performed with
commercially-available displays.  However, these displays have 
unadjustable mechanical and optical properties, which limit the 
experimental questions that can be asked.  In order to ask certain 
questions, it becomes necessary to build a custom display, using 
off-the-shelf optical components.  In the field of visual perception, 
such devices are often developed, and are called haploscopes.  In this 
paper, we describe the mechanical design of an AR haploscope, which 
can present virtual objects seen in augmented reality.  In order to 
make accurate measurements, the haploscope must be carefully 
calibrated, but this calibration is quite difficult.  Therefore, this 
abstract contributes a description of an AR haploscope, and outlines 
calibration procedures.
