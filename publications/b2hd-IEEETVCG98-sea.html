<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract">  This paper describes three new results for volume rendering algorithms utilizing splatting. First, an antialiasing extension to the basic splatting algorithm is introduced that mitigates the spatial aliasing for high-resolution volumes. Aliasing can be severe for high-resolution volumes or volumes where a high depth of field leads to converging samples along the perspective axis. Next, an analysis of the common approximation errors in the splatting process for perspective viewing is presented. In this context, we give different implementations, distinguished by efficiency and accuracy, for adding the splat contributions to the image plane. We then present new results in controlling the splatting errors and also show their behavior in the framework of our new antialiasing technique. Finally, current work in progress on extensions to splatting for temporal antialiasing is demonstrated. Here, we present a simple but highly effective scheme for adding motion blur to fast moving volumes. </p>

This paper describes three new results for volume rendering algorithms utilizing 
splatting. First, an antialiasing extension to the basic splatting algorithm is 
introduced that mitigates the spatial aliasing for high-resolution 
volumes. Aliasing can be severe for high-resolution volumes or volumes where a 
high depth of field leads to converging samples along the perspective 
axis. Next, an analysis of the common approximation errors in the splatting 
process for perspective viewing is presented. In this context, we give different 
implementations, distinguished by efficiency and accuracy, for adding the splat 
contributions to the image plane. We then present new results in controlling the 
splatting errors and also show their behavior in the framework of our new 
antialiasing technique. Finally, current work in progress on extensions to 
splatting for temporal antialiasing is demonstrated. Here, we present a simple 
but highly effective scheme for adding motion blur to fast moving volumes.
