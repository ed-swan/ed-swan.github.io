  abstract = {
Many augmented reality (AR) applications require observers to shift 
their gaze between AR and real-world content.  To date, commercial optical 
see-through (OST) AR displays have presented content at either a single focal 
distance, or at a small number of fixed focal distances.  Meanwhile, real-world 
stimuli can occur at a variety of focal distances.  Therefore, when shifting 
gaze between AR and real-world content, in order to view new content in sharp 
focus, observers must often change their eye's accommodative state.  When 
performed repetitively, this can negatively affect task performance and eye 
fatigue.  However, these effects may be under reported, because past research 
has not yet considered the potential additional effect of distracting real world 
backgrounds. 
An experimental method that analyzes background effects is presented, using a 
text-based visual search task that requires integrating information presented in 
both AR and the real world.  An experiment is reported, which examined the 
effect of a distracting background versus a blank background, at focal switching 
distances of 0, 1.33, 2.0, and 3.33 meters.  Qualitatively, a majority of the 
participants reported that the distracting background made the task more 
difficult and fatiguing.  Quantitatively, increasing the focal switching 
distance resulted in reduced task performance and increased eye fatigue. 
However, changing the background, between blank and distracting, did not result 
in significant measured differences. Suggestions are given for further efforts 
to examine background effects.
