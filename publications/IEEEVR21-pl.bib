  abstract =    {
For optical, see-through augmented reality (AR), a new method for measuring 
the perceived three-dimensional location of a small virtual object is 
presented, where participants verbally report the virtual object's location 
relative to both a horizontal and vertical grid. The method is tested with a 
Microsoft HoloLens AR display, and examines two different virtual object 
designs, whether turning in a circle between reported object locations 
disrupts HoloLens tracking, and whether accuracy errors found with a HoloLens 
display might be due to systematic errors that are restricted to that 
particular display.  Turning in a circle did not disrupt HoloLens tracking, 
and a second HoloLens did not suggest systematic errors restricted to a 
specific display.  The proposed method could measure the perceived location of 
a virtual object to a precision of 1 mm.
