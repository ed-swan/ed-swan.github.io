Not all virtual reality applications today require the power or expense of 
single large visualization "supercomputers".  Factors such as frame rate and 
polygon count have a major impact upon the performance of a VR application. 
Increasingly, low cost commodity consumer electronics and computing technology 
are becoming powerful enough to present an acceptable level of graphics 
performance.  Already, commodity PCs are driving virtual reality workbenches 
with stereo and tracking options. The next step is to have them drive 
multi-screen environ-ments. 
We present an experiment motivated by the low cost per performance of PC 
commodity clusters. The experiment is to replace a visualization super-computing 
platform driving a 4-wall immersive display system [1] with a PC commodity 
cluster. We describe the system, implementation and experimental testing in the 
paper.
