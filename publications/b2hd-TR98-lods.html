<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract">  We present a new rendering technique, termed <em>LOD-sprite</em> rendering, which uses a combination of a level-of-detail (LOD) representation of the scene together with reusing image sprites (previously rendered images).  Our primary application is an acceleration technique for virtual environment navigation. The LOD-sprite technique renders an initial frame using a full-resolution model of the scene geometry.  It renders subsequent frames with a much lower-resolution model of the scene geometry and texture-maps each polygon with the image sprite from the initial full-resolution frame.  As it renders these subsequent frames the technique measures the error associated with each low-resolution polygon, and uses this to decide when to re-render the scene using the full-resolution model. The LOD-sprite technique can be efficiently implemented in texture-mapping graphics hardware. The LOD-sprite technique is thus a combination of two currently very active thrusts in computer graphics: level-of-detail representations and image-based modeling and rendering (IBMR) techniques.  The LOD-sprite technique is different from most previous IBMR techniques in that they typically model the texture-map as a quadrilateral, as opposed to a lower-resolution scene model.  This scene model, even if only composed of a few polygons, greatly increases the range of novel views that can be interpolated before unacceptable distortions arise. Also unlike previous LOD techniques, the LOD-sprite algorithm dynamically updates the image sprite every several frames.  The LOD-sprite technique can be implemented with any LOD decomposition. </p>

The LOD-sprite technique renders an initial frame using a full-resolution model

model, even if only composed of a few polygons, greatly increases the range of
