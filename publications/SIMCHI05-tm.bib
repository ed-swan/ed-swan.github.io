Mobile augmented reality (AR) combines 3D spatially registered 
graphics and sounds with a user's perception of the real 
world. Combining mobile AR with computer simulation promises to 
revolutionize practicing and training for many tasks, especially those 
that are naturally conducted in the real world. However, to achieve 
this potential, the field needs a much better understanding of how 
users perceive and comprehend information that is mediated by an AR 
display. We review the work that has been performed in this area to 
date and discuss the challenges presented by perceptual issues in AR 
for training systems. Then we describe our application of experimental 
methodologies which address perceptual and cognitive issues, employs 
subject matter experts to ensure domain relevance, and address the 
limitations of emerging technology. We apply these methodologies in 
the context of a mobile AR simulation system that we have developed to 
support military training.
