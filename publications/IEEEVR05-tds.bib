A challenge in presenting augmenting information in outdoor augmented reality 
(AR) settings lies in the broad range of uncontrollable environmental conditions 
that may be present, specifically large-scale fluctuations in natural lighting 
and wide variations in likely backgrounds or objects in the scene.  In this 
paper, we present a user-based study which examined the effects of outdoor 
background textures, changing outdoor illuminance values, and text drawing 
styles on user performance of a text identification task with an optical, 
see-through augmented reality system.  We report significant effects for all of 
these variables, and discuss design guidelines and ideas for future work.
