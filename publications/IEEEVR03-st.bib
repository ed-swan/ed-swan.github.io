In this paper we describe two engineering experiments designed to evaluate the 
effectiveness of Measurand's ShapeTape for wearable, mobile interaction. Our 
initial results suggest that the ShapeTape is not appropriate for interactions 
which require a high degree of accuracy. However, ShapeTape is capable of 
reproducing the qualitative motion the user is performing and thus could be used 
to support 3D gesture-based interaction.
