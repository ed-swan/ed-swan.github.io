Usability engineering is a cost-effective, user-centered process that ensures a 
high level of effectiveness, efficiency, and safety in complex interactive 
systems.  This paper presents a brief description of usability engineering 
activities, and discusses our experiences with leading usability engineering 
activities for three very different types of interactive applications: a 
responsive workbench-based command and control application called Dragon, a 
wearable augmented reality application for urban warfare called Battlefield 
Augmented Reality System (BARS), and a head-mounted hardware device, called 
Nomad, for dismounted soldiers.  For each application, we present our approach 
to usability engineering, how we tailored the usability engineering process and 
methods to address application-specific needs, and give results.
