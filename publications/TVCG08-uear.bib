  abstract =     { 
A major challenge, and thus opportunity, in the field of human-computer 
interaction and specifically usability engineering is designing effective user 
interfaces for emerging technologies that have no established design guidelines 
or interaction metaphors or introduce completely new ways for users to perceive 
and interact with technology and the world around them.  Clearly, augmented 
reality is one such emerging technology.  We propose a usability engineering 
approach that employs user-based studies to inform design, by iteratively 
inserting a series of user-based studies into a traditional usability 
engineering lifecycle to better inform initial user interface designs.  We 
present an exemplar user-based study conducted to gain insight into how users 
perceive text in outdoor augmented reality settings and to derive implications 
for design in outdoor augmented reality.  We also describe "lessons learned" 
from our experiences conducting user-based studies as part of the design 
process.
