Does visually perceived distance differ when objects are viewed in
augmented reality (AR), as opposed to the real world? What are the
differences? These questions are theoretically interesting, and the
answers are important for the development of many tablet- and
phone-based AR applications, including mobile AR navigation systems.
This paper presents a thorough literature review of distance judgment
experimental protocols, and results from several areas of perceptual
psychology.  In addition to distance judgments of real and virtual
objects, this section also discusses previous work in measuring the
geometry of virtual picture space, and considers how this work might
be relevant to tablet AR.  Then, the paper presents the results of two
experiments.  In each experiment, observers bisected egocentric
distances of 15 and 30 meters, in tablet-based AR and in the real
world, in both indoor corridor and outdoor field environments.  In AR,
observers bisected the distances to virtual humans, while in the real
world, they bisected the distances to real humans.  This is the first
reported research that directly compares distance judgments of real
and virtual objects in a tablet AR system.  Four key findings were:
(1) In AR, observers expanded midpoint intervals at 15 meters, but
compressed midpoints at 30 meters.  (2) Observers were accurate in the
real world.  (3) The environmental setting—corridor or open field—had
no effect.  (4) The picture perception literature is important in
understanding how distances are likely judged in tablet-based AR.
Taken together, these findings suggest the depth distortions that AR
application developers should expect with mobile and especially
tablet-based AR.
