This case study describes a technique for the three-dimensional 
analysis of the internal microscopic structure ("microstructure") of 
materials.  This technique consists of incrementally polishing through 
a thin layer (approximately 0.2 ${\mu}$m) of material, chemically 
etching the polished surface, applying reference marks, and performing 
optical or scanning electron microscopy on selected areas. The series 
of images are then processed employing AVS and other visualization 
software to obtain a 3D reconstruction of the material.  We describe 
how we applied this technique to an alloy steel to study the 
morphology, connectivity, and distribution of cementite precipitates 
formed during thermal processing.  The results showed microstructural 
features not previously identified with traditional 2D techniques.
