In previous papers, a novel haploscope-based AR environment was 
implemented [1, 3]. In that system, a participant looks through a set 
of reflective lenses onto a real-world environment. However, at the 
same time, there are monitors to the side displaying a virtual 
object. This object is reflected onto the lenses and is thus, from the 
viewpoint of the participant, overlaid onto the real environment. In 
Hua [1], some initial work was done designing a calibration procedure 
for this haploscope-based AR environment. The current work seeks to 
modify and expand Huaâ€™s original calibration procedure to make it both 
more effective and more efficient. As part of developing this new 
calibration procedure, this paper examines potential sources of error 
and recommends processes and steps for reducing or eliminating these 
potential error sources.
