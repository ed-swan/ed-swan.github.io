In augmented reality (AR) environments, information is often
distributed between real and virtual contexts, and often appears at
different distances from the user.  Therefore, to integrate the
information, users must repeatedly switch context and refocus the
eyes.  Previously, Gabbard, Mehra, and Swan (2018) examined these
issues, using a text-based visual search task and a monocular optical
see-through AR display.  In this work, the authors report a
replication of this earlier experiment, using a custom-built AR
haploscope.  The successful replication, on a very different display,
is consistent with the hypothesis that the findings are a general
property of AR.
