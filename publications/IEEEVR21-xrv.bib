Usable x-ray vision has long been a goal in augmented reality research and
development. X-ray vision, or the ability to view and understand information 
presented through an opaque barrier, would be imminently useful across a variety 
of domains. Unfortunately, however, the effect of x-ray vision on situation 
awareness, an operator's understanding of a task or environment, has not been 
significantly studied. This is an important question; if x-ray vision does not 
increase situation awareness, of what use is it? Thus, we have developed an 
x-ray vision system, in order to investigate situation awareness in the context 
of action space distances.
