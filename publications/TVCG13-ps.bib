  abstract =     { 
The following series of experiments explore the effect of static peripheral 
stimulation on the perception of distance and spatial scale in a typical 
head-mounted virtual environment. It was found that applying constant white 
light in an observerâ€™s far periphery enabled the observer to more accurately 
judge distances using blind walking. An effect of similar magnitude was also 
found when observers estimated the size of a virtual space using a visual scale 
task. The presence of the effect across multiple psychophysical tasks provided 
confidence that a perceptual change was, in fact, being invoked by the addition 
of the peripheral stimulation. These results were also compared to observer 
performance in a very large field of view virtual environment and in the real 
world. The subsequent findings raise the possibility that distance judgments in 
virtual environments might be considerably more similar to those in the real 
world than previous work has suggested.
