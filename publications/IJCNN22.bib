  abstract =    {
Modern machine learning (ML) is based to a great extent on supervised deep 
learning models that require large amounts of labeled training data. While image 
data sets with annotations exist, the annotations are produced manually and 
possess relatively simple descriptions.  To date, none of the freely available 
labeled image data sets incorporate spatial reasoning, one of Gardner's nine 
human intelligences.  This article presents a new process with open source tools 
provided to label imagery based on spatial interactions between image objects 
and automated reasoning under uncertainty. The resulting annotated data can be 
used to train new ML/AI algorithms and/or help us better understand existing 
methodologies.
