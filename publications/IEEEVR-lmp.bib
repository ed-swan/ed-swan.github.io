<p>Next generation OST HMDs promise the inclusion of a variety of 
integrated and on-board sensors. In particular, hand tracking cameras, such 
as the Leap Motion, show potential for facilitating intuitive OST 
calibration procedures accessible to researchers, developers, and novice 
users alike. In this work, we evaluate hand and stylus based OST 
calibration utilizing tracking data from a Leap Motion. Our findings show 
that performance of both methods is comparable to results from prior 
studies using standard environment-centric methods. Also, while our hand 
based calibration improved through the use of more contextual reticle 
designs, calibrations performed with a stylus yielded the most accurate and 
precise results over all.</p>
