  abstract = {
In room-clearing tasks, SWAT team members suffer from a lack of initial
environmental information: knowledge about what is in a room and what relevance 
or threat level it represents for mission parameters. Normally this gap in 
situation awareness is rectified only upon room entry, forcing SWAT team members 
to rely on quick responses and near-instinctual reactions. This can lead to 
dangerously escalating situations or important missed information which, in 
turn, can increase the likelihood of injury and even mortality. Thus, we present 
an x-ray vision system for the dynamic scanning and display of room content, 
using a robotic platform to mitigate operator risk. This system maps a room 
using a robot-equipped stereo depth camera and, using an augmented reality (AR) 
system, presents the resulting geographic information according to the 
perspective of each officer. This intervention has the potential to notably 
lower risk and increase officer situation awareness, all while team members are 
in the relative safety of cover. With these potential stakes, it is important to 
test the viability of this system natively and in an operational SWAT team 
context.
