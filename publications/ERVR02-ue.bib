This paper discusses our usability engineering process for the Battlefield 
Augmented Reality System (BARS).  Usability engineering is a structured, 
iterative, stepwise development process.  Like the related disciplines of 
software and systems engineering, usability engineering is a combination of 
management principals and techniques, formal and semi-formal evaluation 
techniques, and computerized tools.  BARS is an outdoor augmented reality system 
that displays heads-up battlefield intelligence information to a dismounted 
warrior.  The paper discusses our general usability engineering process.  We 
originally developed the process in the context of virtual reality applications, 
but in this work we are adapting the procedures to an augmented reality system. 
The focus of this paper is our work is on domain analysis, the first activity of 
the usability engineering process.  We describe our plans for and our progress 
to date on our domain analysis for BARS.  We give results in terms of a specific 
urban battlefield use case we have designed.
