          <dt>Required Text</dt>

          <dd><i>Game Design: Principles, Practice, and Techniques&mdash;The
          Ultimate Guide for the Aspiring Game Designer</i>; Jim Thompson,
          Barnaby Berbank-Green, Nic Cusworth; John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2007;

        </dl>

        <h1>Course Content</h1>

        <p>This course will be evaluated on four major criteria:</p>

        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>Games</li>

          <li>Class Presentations and Assignments</li>

          <li>Midterm Examination</li>

          <li>Final Examination</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The primary activity of this class will be collaboratively
        developing three games in an interdisciplinary small team format.&nbsp;
        Students will make class presentations and complete a few design
        assignments.&nbsp; The class presentations will primarily involve
        demonstrating and analyzing existing computer games, but they may also
        involve presenting various game design topics.&nbsp; The midterm and
        final exams will put the course material into context and allow
        students to demonstrate their mastery of the analysis topics.</p>

        <h2>Grading</h2>

        <p>Grades will be generated by the following activities:</p>

        <table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="3" style=
        "margin-left: 3em; text-align:left;">
          <tr>
            <td style="padding-right:1em;"><b>Games:</b></td>

            <td>First Game:</td>

            <td>15%</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>

            <td>Second Game:</td>

            <td>20%</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>

            <td>Third Game:</td>

            <td>20%</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td colspan="2" style="padding-right:2em"><b>Class Presentations
            and Assignments:</b></td>

            <td>15%</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td colspan="2"><b>Midterm:</b></td>

            <td>15%</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td colspan="2"><b>Final:</b></td>

            <td>15%</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Grades will be determined by the following scale:</p>

        <table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="3" style="margin-left: 3em">
          <tr>
            <td>90% &ndash; 100%</td>

            <td>A</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>80% &ndash; 89%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            <td>B</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>70% &ndash; 79%</td>

            <td>C</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>60% &ndash; 69%</td>

            <td>D</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>0% &ndash; 59%</td>

            <td>F</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>As this is meant to be a collaborative environment, students are not
        competing against each other, and therefore this course is not graded
        on a curve.</p>

        <h2>Game Design Assignments</h2>

        <p>In this class, students will spend the majority of their time
        designing and implementing computer games.&nbsp; This will occur in
        small teams of students of about 2&ndash;5 members.&nbsp; Students will
        be (semi-) randomly assigned to teams.&nbsp; Students will design three
        games; after each game, teams will disband and new teams will be
        formed.</p>

        <p>During the design process, teams will present periodic progress
        reports in class.&nbsp; For the second and third games, design
        documents will be required as games are developed.&nbsp; On the day a
        game is due, teams will present their game to the class, and will turn
        in source code and other materials related to the game including
        screenshots of play.&nbsp; Teams may be required to turn in
        game-related documentation as well.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Grading:</span> Games will be subjectively
        graded.&nbsp; The primary grading criteria will be the degree to which
        the game meets its assigned objectives.&nbsp; Additional criteria may
        include evidence of how much effort the team has invested in the game,
        creativity, and the quality of submitted materials such as code, design
        documents, concept drawings, research results, etc.&nbsp; The result of
        this grading process will be a <em>team grade.</em>&nbsp; The baseline
        grade for each team member will be equal to the team grade, but may be
        modified up or down based on peer feedback and instructor feedback.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Peer and Instructor Feedback:</span> After
        each game is completed, team members will be asked to anonymously
        evaluate each other along dimensions related to contribution level and
        how easy they are to work with.&nbsp; A team member's grade may be
        modified either up or down by this feedback.&nbsp; Each team member
        will receive an anonymized version of this feedback.&nbsp; In addition,
        the instructor may further adjust a team member's grade up or down,
        based on observation of the team member's contribution level, both to
        the development of the game as well as to the class as a whole.&nbsp;
        Any such adjustments will be communicated to each affected student.</p>

        <h2>Game Analysis</h2>

        <p>An important distinction between playing games and studying games is
        the ability to reflect upon the game play experience.&nbsp; A useful
        tool for being reflective is writing, and hence the game session
        logging (gamelog) assignments ask students to write about their
        experience playing a game.</p>

        <p>Game analysis will be performed using the <a href=
        "http://www.gamelog.cl/" title="Game Log">Game Log</a> website.&nbsp;
        To write a gamelog, log into the site and write a gamelog entry.&nbsp;
        When creating an identity on the Gamelog site, select any non-profane
        username desired; indicate this username when completing the analysis
        assignment.</p>

        <p>Students are strongly encouraged read the gamelog entries of other
        people in the class, as well as other gameloggers worldwide.&nbsp; If
        there are gamelogs that are interesting or controversial, students are
        free to write comments about them.&nbsp; The process of reflecting on
        the gamelogs of other players is also a valuable way to expand one's
        understanding of the interrelationships of design elements in games,
        and players' reactions to those elements.&nbsp; Students get out of
        gamelogging what they put into it.</p>

        <p>Note that Mississippi State's acceptable use policies apply when
        using this site for assignments.</p>

        <p>Gamelogs are subjective: There is no wrong answer when writing
        them.&nbsp; However, it is possible to write excessively short,
        trivial, or non-reflective gamelogs.&nbsp; Poor grammar, spelling, or
        rhetoric also hurts the gamelog.&nbsp; Gamelogs will be evaluated on a
        10 point scale as follows:</p>

        <ul class="hanging">
          <li><b>Not Submitted:</b> No credit (0 points).</li>

          <li><b>Below Expectations:</b> Trivial write-up or analysis lacking
          depth, perhaps with poor grammar or spelling (1&ndash;5 points).</li>

          <li><b>Meets Expectations:</b> Sufficient write-up with good insight;
          few grammatical or spelling errors (6&ndash;10 points)</li>

          <li><b>Exceeds Expectations:</b> In-depth write-up with exceptional
          insights; no errors in the writing (&gt; 10 points possible).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Game analysis assignments are part of the <em>Class Presentations
        and Assignments</em> portion of the course grade.</p>

        <h2>Game Presentation</h2>

        <p>Hands-on critiquing of games is an important for mastering game
        design.&nbsp; Thus, each student will present a game they have played
        in class.&nbsp; <em>Presenting</em> a game means playing the game,
        demonstrating the game's features, and critiquing the game according to
        the analysis frameworks we will study in class.&nbsp; The critique
        should answer the questions <q>why (or why not) is this game fun?</q>,
        <q>what is novel about this game?</q>, and <q>how could this game be
        improved (if at all)?</q>.</p>

        <p>Students will present and critique the game, including examples of
        play, during class.&nbsp; Some game systems and games can be provided,
        and the instructor will discuss how students can borrow them.&nbsp;
        Grading will be subjective, and based primarily on the apparent effort
        involved in demonstrating and critiquing the game.&nbsp; Game
        presentations will be evaluated on a 10 point scale as follows:</p>

        <ul class="hanging">
          <li><b>Not Presented:</b> No credit (0 points).</li>

          <li><b>Below Expectations:</b> Trivial analysis lacking depth;
          demonstration does not cover important features of the game
          (1&ndash;5 points).</li>

          <li><b>Meets Expectations:</b> Good analysis touching on major
          components; gameplay demonstrates most features.&nbsp; Full-credit
          (6&ndash;10 points).</li>

          <li><b>Exceeds Expectations:</b> Insightful deconstruction of the
          game and its impact; clever demonstration of the game's features
          (&gt; 10 points possible).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Game analysis assignments are part of the <em>Class Presentations
        and Assignments</em> portion of the course grade.</p>

        <h2>Exams</h2>

        <p>The format and content of the exams will be announced before
        each.&nbsp; Generally, they will be comprehensive exams which cover the
        concepts and principles discussed in the lectures and the book.</p>

        <h2>Missed Assignments or Exams</h2>

        <p>Missed assignments or exams fall into two categories: Excused or
        unexcused.&nbsp; Excused absences occur when you know about the
        potential absence ahead of time and discuss a resolution with me at
        least a week beforehand; usually, this involves modifying the due date
        or scheduling a make-up.&nbsp; If you miss an assignment or exam, they
        you must meet with me at the earliest opportunity and provide
        documentation justifying the absence to make the absence an excused
        one.&nbsp; Absences that are unexcused for more than a week will
        generally receive no points on the assignment or exam.</p>

        <h1>Policies</h1>

        <h2>Academic Honesty and the Honor Code</h2>

        <p>In this course, students are expected to uphold the <a href=
        "http://students.msstate.edu/honorcode/">Mississippi State University
        Honor Code</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"As a Mississippi State University student I will conduct myself
          with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or
          steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do."</p>

          <p>Upon accepting admission to Mississippi State University, a
          student immediately assumes a commitment to uphold the Honor Code, to
          accept responsibility for learning, and to follow the philosophy and
          rules of the Honor Code.&nbsp; Students will be required to state
          their commitment on examinations, research papers, and other academic
          work.&nbsp; Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the
          MSU community from the requirements or the processes of the Honor
          Code.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Students are also expected to maintain the standards of academic
        honesty that are described in the <a href=
        "http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/understud/honesty.php">CSE
        Department's Undergraduate Studies Academic Honesty Policy</a> (CSE
        4990), or the <a href=
        "http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/gradstud/honesty.php">CSE
        Department's Graduate Studies Academic Honesty Policy</a> (CSE
        6990).&nbsp; These standards apply in their entirety to the
        <b>midterm</b> and the <b>final exam:</b></p>

        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>Do not cheat on a quiz or exam.&nbsp;</li>

          <li>Do not turn in someone else's work, on a programming assignment
          or any other type of assignment, as if it were your own.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>

        <p>However, in the real world people work in teams, and games will be
        developed collaboratively by teams of students.</p>

        <p>These are important policies.&nbsp; Not only will violators fail to
        learn the course material, but violators will receive an XF in this
        course, and will otherwise be handled according the CSE Department's
        Undergraduate or Graduate Studies Academic Honesty Policies, as well as
        the <a href="http://www.honorcode.msstate.edu/policy/">Academic
        Operating Policy and Procedure of Mississippi State University</a>.</p>

        <p>As a professor at Mississippi State University, I am required to
        report all incidents of academic misconduct.</p>

        <h2>Additional Policies</h2>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Attendance and Audits</span>: Attendance is
        required in this class.&nbsp; Although attendance will not affect your
        grade, I will take roll, and I will list absences on midterm and final
        grade reports.&nbsp; Students who miss class are still responsible for
        the material covered and for any assignments distributed.&nbsp;
        Students who are auditing the course must attend at least 75% of the
        class meetings in order to receive a passing grade.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Personal Electronic Devices</span>: Students
        must respect their fellow students and not disrupt class. Therefore,
        cell phones, pagers, other such alarms, or personal conversations which
        disturb the lecture are not allowed.&nbsp; Students with personal
        laptops are encouraged to bring them to class lectures.&nbsp; Laptops
        are required for course exams.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Grade of Incomplete (I)</span>: Following MSU
        policy, incomplete grades will only be given in extreme circumstances,
        such as illness, death in a student's immediate family, or similar
        circumstances beyond a student's control.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">No Food or Drinks in Class</span>: It is the
        CSE department's policy that you can't eat or dink in Butler hall
        classrooms.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Email</span>: When I send class-related
        email, I will use your <a href=
        "mailto:student_netid@msstate.edu">student_netid@msstate.edu</a> email
        address.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Drop / Add Policy</span>: This class follows
        <a href="http://www.msstate.edu/dept/audit/1201.html">Mississippi State
        University's Official Drop/Add Policy</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><b>Add/Drop without penalty</b> - A student has through the fifth
          class day into the semester to drop a course and through the sixth
          class day to add a course without being assessed a fee or academic
          penalty.</p>

          <p><b>Drop after the fifth class day through the 30th class day into
          the semester</b> - A student who elects to drop a course during this
          period must receive the approval of his/her advisor, will be assigned
          a W on his/her academic record, and be assessed a fee.&nbsp; The
          advisor who permits the drop will specify its effective
          date.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><b>Drop after the 30th class day into the semester</b> &ndash; A
          student cannot drop courses after this period except in documented
          cases of serious illness, extreme hardship, or failure of the
          instructor to provide significant assessment of his/her
          performance.&nbsp;&nbsp; A request to drop a course during this
          period must be approved by the student&rsquo;s advisor and academic
          dean.&nbsp; The dean who permits the drop will specify its effective
          date.&nbsp; A student receiving permission to drop will receive a W
          on his/her academic record and be assessed a fee.</p>

          <p>Faculty are expected to provide a student with significant
          evidence or assessment of his/her class performance within the first
          30 class days of the semester.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Right to Change</h2>

        <p>I reserve the right to change the course policies or schedule in
        order to facilitate instruction.&nbsp; Any such changes will be
        discussed in class and updated on the course web site.</p>
