        <h2>Group Design Projects</h2>

        <p>In this class, students will spend the majority of their time
        designing and implementing user interface designs.&nbsp; This will
        occur in small teams of students; we will aim for team sizes of
        2&ndash;5 members.&nbsp; Students will be semi-randomly assigned to
        teams.&nbsp; We will have 3 design projects this semester.&nbsp; After
        each project, teams will disband and new teams will be formed.</p>

        <p>During the design process, teams will present periodic progress
        reports in class.&nbsp; On the day a design is due, teams will present
        their design to the class, and will turn in materials (drawings,
        mockups, slides, documents, source code, etc.) related to the
        design.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Grading</span>: I will subjectively grade the
        interface designs.&nbsp; The primary grading criteria will be the
        degree to which the design meets its assigned objectives.&nbsp;
        Additional criteria may include evidence of how much effort the team
        has invested in the design, creativity, and the quality of submitted
        materials.&nbsp; The result of this grading process will be a <em>team
        grade</em>. &nbsp;The baseline grade for each team member will be equal
        to the team grade, but may be modified up or down based on <em>peer
        feedback</em> and <em>instructor feedback</em>.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Peer and Instructor Feedback</span>: After
        each design is completed, team members will be asked to anonymously
        evaluate each other along dimensions related to contribution level and
        how easy they are to work with.&nbsp; A team member's grade may be
        modified either up or down by this feedback.&nbsp; Each team member
        will receive an anonymized version of this feedback.&nbsp; In addition,
        the instructor may further adjust a team member's grade up or down,
        based on his observation of the team member's contribution level, both
        to the development of the interface design as well as to the class as a
        whole.&nbsp; Any such adjustments will be communicated to each affected
        student.&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Class Presentations and Assignments</h2>

        <p>Students will make class presentations, and may complete additional
        assignments.&nbsp; The class presentations will primarily involve
        demonstrating and analyzing user interfaces and interaction
        techniques.&nbsp; Assignments may be in-class or take-home
        (homework).&nbsp; In-class activities will have either a written
        component for students to prepare individually in advance, or a group
        assignment to be done in class.&nbsp; Take-home assignments are due by
        class time on the due date; they will not be accepted after the
        beginning of class.</p>

        <h2>Exams</h2>

        <p>The format and content of the exams will be announced before
        each.&nbsp; Generally, they will be comprehensive exams which cover the
        concepts and principles discussed in the lectures and the readings.</p>

        <h2>Missed Assignments and Exams</h2>

        <p>Missed assignments or exams fall into two categories:
        <em>excused</em> or <em>unexcused</em>.&nbsp; Excused absences occur
        when you know about the potential absence ahead of time and discuss a
        resolution with the instructor at least a week beforehand; usually,
        this involves modifying the due date or scheduling a make-up
        exam.&nbsp; If you miss an assignment or exam, they you must meet with
        the instructor at the earliest opportunity and provide documentation
        justifying the absence to make the absence an excused one.&nbsp;
        Absences that are unexcused for more than a week will generally receive
        no points on the assignment or exam.&nbsp; If a missed exam absence is
        excused, then I will substitute the average number of points of your
        other exams for the missed exam.</p>

        <h2>Academic Honesty / Misconduct and Collaboration</h2>

        <p>In this course, students are expected to uphold the <a target=
        "_blank" href="http://students.msstate.edu/honorcode/">Mississippi
        State University Honor Code</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"As a Mississippi State University student I will conduct myself
          with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or
          steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do."</p>

          <p>Upon accepting admission to Mississippi State University, a
          student immediately assumes a commitment to uphold the Honor Code, to
          accept responsibility for learning, and to follow the philosophy and
          rules of the Honor Code.&nbsp; Students will be required to state
          their commitment on examinations, research papers, and other academic
          work.&nbsp; Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the
          MSU community from the requirements or the processes of the Honor
          Code.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Students are also expected to maintain the standards of academic
        honesty that are described in the <a href=
        "http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/understud/honesty.php" target=
        "_blank">CSE Department's Undergraduate Studies Academic Honesty
        Policy</a> (CSE 4833), or the <a href=
        "http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/gradstud/honesty.php" target=
        "_blank">CSE Department's Graduate Studies Academic Honesty Policy</a>
        (CSE 6833).&nbsp; These standards apply in their entirety to the
        <b>midterm</b> and the <b>final exam</b>.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>However, in the real world people work in teams, and interface
        designs will be developed collaboratively by teams of students.</p>

        <p>These are important policies.&nbsp; Not only will violators fail to
        learn the course material, but violators will receive an "XF" in this
        course, and will otherwise be handled according the CSE Department's
        Undergraduate or Graduate Studies Academic Honesty Policies, as well as
        the <a href="http://www.honorcode.msstate.edu/policy/" target=
        "_blank">Academic Operating Policy and Procedure of Mississippi State
        University</a>.</p>

        <p>As a professor at Mississippi State University, I am required to
        report all incidents of academic misconduct.</p>

        <h2>Right to Change</h2>

        <p>I reserve the right to change the course policies or schedule in
        order to facilitate instruction.&nbsp; Any such changes will be
        discussed in class and updated on the course web site.</p>

        <h2>Additional Policies</h2>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Attendance and Audits</span>: Attendance is
        required in this class.&nbsp; Although attendance will not directly
        affect your grade, I will take roll, and I will list absences on
        midterm and final grade reports.&nbsp; Students who miss class are
        still responsible for the material covered and for any assignments
        distributed.&nbsp; Furthermore, as described above, students who are
        absent for an in-class group activity will not receive any credit for
        that activity.&nbsp; Students who are auditing the course must attend
        at least 75% of the class meetings in order to receive a passing
        grade.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Personal Electronic Devices</span>: Students
        must respect their fellow students and not disrupt class. Therefore,
        cell phones, pagers, other such alarms, or personal conversations which
        disturb the lecture are not allowed.&nbsp; Students with personal
        laptops are encouraged to bring them to class; however, laptops are not
        required for this course.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Grade of Incomplete (I)</span>: Following MSU
        policy, incomplete grades will only be given in extreme circumstances,
        such as illness, death in a student's immediate family, or similar
        circumstances beyond a student's control.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">No Food or Drinks in Class</span>: It is the
        CSE department's policy that you can't eat or dink in Butler Hall
        classrooms.</p>
		<p><span class="parlabel">Email</span>: When I send class-related email, 
		I will use your <a href="mailto:student_netid@msstate.edu">
		student_netid@msstate.edu</a> email address.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Drop / Add Policy</span>: This class follows
        <a target="_blank" href=
        "http://www.msstate.edu/dept/audit/1201.html">Mississippi State
        University's Official Drop/Add Policy</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><b>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Add/Drop without penalty</b> &mdash; A student
          has through the fifth class day into the semester to drop a course
          and through the sixth class day to add a course without being
          assessed a fee or academic penalty.</p>

          <p><b>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drop after the fifth class day through the 30th
          class day into the semester</b> &mdash; A student who elects to drop
          a course during this period must receive the approval of his/her
          advisor, will be assigned a W on his/her academic record, and be
          assessed a fee.&nbsp; The advisor who permits the drop will specify
          its effective date.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><b>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drop after the 30th class day into the
          semester</b> &mdash; A student cannot drop courses after this period
          except in documented cases of serious illness, extreme hardship, or
          failure of the instructor to provide significant assessment of
          his/her performance.&nbsp;&nbsp; A request to drop a course during
          this period must be approved by the student&rsquo;s advisor and
          academic dean.&nbsp; The dean who permits the drop will specify its
          effective date.&nbsp; A student receiving permission to drop will
          receive a W on his/her academic record and be assessed a fee.</p>

          <p><b>D.</b>&nbsp; Faculty are expected to provide a student with
          significant evidence or assessment of his/her class performance
          within the first 30 class days of the semester.</p>
