        <p><span class="parlabel">Programming Assignments</span>: We will have
        3&minus;5 programming assignments during the semester.&nbsp; These
        assignments will involve writing a simple ray tracer, and then
        successively adding additional features and capabilities.&nbsp; Each
        programming assignment will count an equal weight for the final
        grade.&nbsp; Programming assignments are discussed in more detail
        below.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Midterm Exam</span>: We will have one written
        midterm exam.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Class Presentation</span>: Towards the end of
        the semester, students will each present an advanced topic in computer
        graphics to the rest of the class.&nbsp; This topic will be described
        in a book chapter and/or 2&minus;4 papers; papers will be chosen from a
        mixture of "classic" and "new" papers that have been published in the
        computer graphics field.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Final Project</span>: Instead of a final
        exam, we will have a final project, in which students will choose, from
        a list of options, various advanced features and capabilities to add to
        their ray tracer.&nbsp; At the end of the semester students will
        present their finished programs and discuss their generated
        images.&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Discussion Board and Email</h2>

        <p>In this class, my goal is for the myCourses discussion board to be
        the main communication interface between myself, you, and your fellow
        students.&nbsp; Don't immediately send me email with questions about
        the assignments; first try posting your question to the discussion
        board.&nbsp; Often, other students will be able to answer your question
        before I could.&nbsp; My goal is for the course to build upon a
        collaborative environment.</p>

        <p>Since there may be frequent list activity, check the message board
        at least once a day, especially near programming assignment
        deadlines.&nbsp; You are responsible for knowing any material that I
        post.</p>

        <p>The discussion board is a forum for issues related to this
        class.&nbsp; Therefore, do not post rude or irrelevant messages.&nbsp;
        In addition, while algorithms and approaches in general can be
        discussed on the assignment, exact or partial solutions (including code
        detailed snippets) are not allowed.&nbsp; Everyone is to do their own
        work.&nbsp; However, posting your sample images and the input files
        that generated them is <b>highly</b> encouraged!</p>

        <h2>Programming Assignments</h2>

        <p>Programming assignments will make up the bulk of the learning and
        the work in this class.&nbsp; I can't stress enough how important the
        programming assignments are for learning computer graphics.</p>

        <h3>Machines, Languages, and Compilers</h3>

        <p>This is a programming-intensive class, and students are highly
        encouraged to use their own machines.&nbsp; In the past departmental
        machines have been available for students who did not have their own
        machine; please talk to me right away if you do not have a machine that
        you can use.</p>

        <p>Students should use C++ for the assignments.&nbsp; If a student
        wishes to use a different language (for example, Python or Java),
        discuss it with me --- my main concern will be whether we can work out
        a reasonable grading scheme.&nbsp; In general I recommend C++ because
        (1) historically it has been the most widely used language in the
        graphics community (although this is changing), and (2) the primary
        disadvantage of ray tracing is that it is relatively slow, and so a
        fully compiled language such as C++ is preferred over interpreted or
        byte-compiled languages such as Python and Java.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Students may use any compiler they desire to develop and debug the
        lab assignments.&nbsp; However, when it is time to turn the assignments
        in, students' code must compile and link with the following reference
        compiler and library.&nbsp; If the code doesn't compile and execute
        with the reference compiler and library, I won't be able to grade
        it!&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The reference compiler is GNU g++ version 3.4.4.&nbsp; This is
        generally the default compiler for Linux machines.&nbsp; For a Windows
        machine, the easiest way to get g++ is by installing <a href=
        "http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>.&nbsp; I believe that g++ is also
        the default compiler for Macs.&nbsp; The reference library is the
        standard math library, invoked by the linker command '-lm'.&nbsp; Note
        that we will not be using OpenGL, DirectX, or any other graphics
        library in this course!</p>

        <h3>Collaboration</h3>

        <p>Real world programmers work in groups.&nbsp; I encourage students to
        collaborate on programming assignments in terms of <i>discussing
        algorithms</i> and <i>general approaches</i>.&nbsp; Students may also
        assist each other in <i>program debugging</i>. Students may engage in
        these activities through the message boards.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>However, <i>the code for each assignment must be written
        individually by each student</i>.&nbsp; This means do not use source
        code downloaded off the Internet or accessed by other means, and don't
        use outside libraries except for the ones that I provide.&nbsp; This is
        an important policy; violations will be considered academic
        misconduct.</p>

        <h3>Programming Assignment Grading</h3>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Submission</span>: Programming assignments
        will be submitted electronically through the myCourses interface.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Late Submissions</span>: Late programs will
        be penalized by 10% for each 24-hour period after their due date,
        including Saturday and Sunday.&nbsp; In order for maximum learning to
        occur, programs should work completely.&nbsp; If it doesn't work, turn
        it in late, but keep working on it!</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Grading</span>: Precise grading details will
        be provided on an assignment-by-assignment basis.&nbsp; For some
        programming assignments, I will compile and execute your code, and then
        examine the generated images.&nbsp; For other assignments, we will meet
        on the due date, and you will explain your images to me.&nbsp; In
        general, programming assignments will be graded on the following
        criteria:</p>

        <ul class="bullet">
          <li><i>Results</i>: Does the program do what it is supposed to
          do?</li>

          <li><i>Documentation and Program Structure</i>: Does the code contain
          a sufficient quantity of meaningful comments and meaningful variable
          names?&nbsp; Is it well structured and modular?</li>

          <li><i>Demonstration of Knowledge</i>: Does the code demonstrate that
          the student understands the assignment?</li>
        </ul>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Reference Compiler and Library</span>: As
        discussed above, if a program doesn't compile with the reference
        compiler and libraries, you will loose the vast majority of possible
        credit for the assignment.</p>

        <h2>Academic Honesty / Misconduct and Collaboration</h2>

        <p>In this course, students are expected to uphold the <a target=
        "_blank" href="http://students.msstate.edu/honorcode/">Mississippi
        State University Honor Code</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"As a Mississippi State University student I will conduct myself
          with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or
          steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do."</p>

          <p>Upon accepting admission to Mississippi State University, a
          student immediately assumes a commitment to uphold the Honor Code, to
          accept responsibility for learning, and to follow the philosophy and
          rules of the Honor Code.&nbsp; Students will be required to state
          their commitment on examinations, research papers, and other academic
          work.&nbsp; Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the
          MSU community from the requirements or the processes of the Honor
          Code.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Students are also expected to maintain the standards of academic
        honesty that are described in the <a href=
        "http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/gradstud/honesty.php" target=
        "_blank">CSE Department's Graduate Studies Academic Honesty Policy</a>
        (CSE 6833).&nbsp;</p>

        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>Do not cheat on a quiz or exam.&nbsp;</li>

          <li>Do not turn in someone else's work, on a programming assignment
          or any other type of assignment, as if it were your own.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These are important policies.&nbsp; Not only will violators fail to
        learn the course material, but violators will receive an XF in this
        course, and will otherwise be handled according the CSE Department's
        Undergraduate or Graduate Studies Academic Honesty Policies, as well as
        the <a href="http://www.honorcode.msstate.edu/policy/" target=
        "_blank">Academic Operating Policy and Procedure of Mississippi State
        University</a>.</p>

        <p>As a professor at Mississippi State University, I am required to
        report all incidents of academic misconduct.</p>

        <h2>Additional Policies</h2>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Attendance and Audits</span>: Attendance is
        required in this class.&nbsp; Although attendance will not affect your
        grade, I will take roll, and I will list absences on midterm and final
        grade reports. Students who miss class are still responsible for the
        material covered and for any assignments distributed.&nbsp; Students
        who are auditing the course must attend at least 75% of the class
        meetings in order to receive a passing grade.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Personal Electronic Devices</span>: Students
        must respect their fellow students and not disrupt class. Therefore,
        cell phones, pagers, other such alarms, or personal conversations which
        disturb the lecture are not allowed.&nbsp; Students with personal
        laptops are encouraged to bring them to class; however, laptops are not
        required for this course.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Grade of Incomplete (I)</span>: Following MSU
        policy, incomplete grades will only be given in extreme circumstances,
        such as illness, death in a student's immediate family, or similar
        circumstances beyond a student's control.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">No Food or Drinks in Class</span>: It is the
        CSE department's policy that you can't eat or dink in Butler Hall
        classrooms.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Email</span>: When I send class-related
        email, I will use your <a href=
        "mailto:student_netid@msstate.edu">student_netid@msstate.edu</a> email
        address.&nbsp; However, for this class I am more likely to post a
        message to the message boards than send email.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Drop / Add Policy</span>: This class follows
        <a target="_blank" href=
        "http://www.msstate.edu/dept/audit/1201.html">Mississippi State
        University's Official Drop/Add Policy</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><b>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Add/Drop without penalty</b> &mdash; A student
          has through the fifth class day into the semester to drop a course
          and through the sixth class day to add a course without being
          assessed a fee or academic penalty.</p>

          <p><b>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drop after the fifth class day through the 30th
          class day into the semester</b> &mdash; A student who elects to drop
          a course during this period must receive the approval of his/her
          advisor, will be assigned a W on his/her academic record, and be
          assessed a fee.&nbsp; The advisor who permits the drop will specify
          its effective date.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><b>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drop after the 30th class day into the
          semester</b> &mdash; A student cannot drop courses after this period
          except in documented cases of serious illness, extreme hardship, or
          failure of the instructor to provide significant assessment of
          his/her performance.&nbsp;&nbsp; A request to drop a course during
          this period must be approved by the student&rsquo;s advisor and
          academic dean.&nbsp; The dean who permits the drop will specify its
          effective date.&nbsp; A student receiving permission to drop will
          receive a W on his/her academic record and be assessed a fee.</p>

          <p><b>D.</b>&nbsp; Faculty are expected to provide a student with
          significant evidence or assessment of his/her class performance
          within the first 30 class days of the semester.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Right to Change</h2>

        <p>I reserve the right to change the course policies or schedule in
        order to facilitate instruction. Any such changes will be discussed in
        class and updated on the course web site.</p>
