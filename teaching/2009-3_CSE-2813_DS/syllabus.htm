            <td>5%</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Exams</span>: There will be three in-class
        exams during the semester.&nbsp; The lowest exam grade counts half as
        much as the other two; the lowest exam counts 8% and the other two
        exams count 16%.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Quizzes</span>: Approximately 9 in-class
        quizzes will be given.&nbsp; They will be based upon homework problems
        that are assigned for the week.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Final Exam</span>: The final exam will be
        comprehensive, and will be given during the scheduled final exam
        time.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Class Participation</span>: The participation
        grade largely depends upon attendance, attentiveness in class,
        willingness to ask/answer questions, preparation for class, and overall
        attitude.&nbsp; Misuse of laptops could affect the participation
        grade.</p>

        <h1>Honors Credit</h1>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Enrollment</span>: Students taking the class
        for honors credit will have to enroll in one of the honors
        sections.&nbsp; After the last day to add a class, a student enrolled
        in an honors section cannot change to a non-honors section and
        vice-versa.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Honors Project</span>: Honors students will
        complete a programming project in addition to the regular class
        work.&nbsp; Details about the honors projects will be announced early
        in the semester.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Honors Grading</span>: For the honors
        students, the honors project will count for 10% of the overall grade,
        while the remaining 90% of the grade will be calculated as described
        above.&nbsp; Note that failing to submit an honors project will result
        in a grade of 0 for the honors portion of the grade, which will drop
        the overall average by a letter grade.</p>

        <h1>Class Conduct</h1>

        <p>Students should conduct themselves in a professional manner.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Laptops</span>: Laptops should only be used
        for class purposes.&nbsp; If a student uses the laptop for some other
        purpose and distracts others, the student's participation grade could
        be affected.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Personal Electronic Devices</span>: Students
        must respect their fellow students and not disrupt class. Therefore,
        cell phones, pagers, other such alarms, or personal conversations which
        disturb the lecture are not allowed.</p>

        <h1>Class Attendance</h1>

        <p>Attendance is required in this class, and can affect the Class
        Participation grade.&nbsp; I will take roll, and I will list absences
        on midterm and final grade reports.&nbsp; Students who miss class are
        still responsible for the material covered and for any assignments
        distributed.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Students who are auditing the course must attend at least 75% of the
        class meetings in order to receive a passing grade.</p>

        <h1>Missed Exams</h1>

        <p>Occasionally students miss exams. Sometimes the student knows about
        these absences in advance, and sometimes they happen
        unexpectedly.&nbsp; If you know in advance that you will be absent and
        you wish to have the absence considered excused, then you must meet
        with me before the date of the exam, and I will let you know whether or
        not the absence will be excused.&nbsp; If the absence is excused, I
        will make arrangements for you to take the exam early.</p>

        <p>If you miss an exam unexpectedly and wish to have the absence
        considered excused, then you must meet with the me at the earliest
        opportunity possible after the absence, and provide documentation to
        support your claim that the absence should be considered excused.&nbsp;
        If the absence is excused, then I will substitute the average number of
        points of your other exams for the missed exam.</p>

        <p>For unexcused absences from examinations you will unfortunately
        receive a score of zero points.</p>

        <h1>Grading and Appeals</h1>

        <p>I will be working with a grader this semester.&nbsp; If you disagree
        with a grade, you need to provide me with a written appeal.&nbsp;
        Although you can discuss a grade with me, I generally won't make a
        decision regarding the grade based on a discussion, but only on a
        written appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>Academic Honesty and Misconduct</h1>

        <p>In this course, students are expected to uphold the <a target=
        "_blank" href="http://students.msstate.edu/honorcode/">Mississippi
        State University Honor Code</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"As a Mississippi State University student I will conduct myself
          with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or
          steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do."</p>

          <p>Upon accepting admission to Mississippi State University, a
          student immediately assumes a commitment to uphold the Honor Code, to
          accept responsibility for learning, and to follow the philosophy and
          rules of the Honor Code.&nbsp; Students will be required to state
          their commitment on examinations, research papers, and other academic
          work.&nbsp; Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the
          MSU community from the requirements or the processes of the Honor
          Code.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Students are also expected to maintain the standards of academic
        honesty that are described in the <a target="_blank" href=
        "http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/understud/honesty.php">CSE
        Department's Undergraduate Studies Academic Honesty Policy</a>.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Do not cheat on a quiz or exam.&nbsp;</li>

          <li>Do not turn in someone else's work, on a programming assignment
          or any other type of assignment, as if it were your own.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This are important policies.&nbsp; Not only will violators fail to
        learn the course material, but violators will receive an "XF" in this
        course, and will otherwise be handled according the CSE Department's
        Undergraduate or Graduate Studies Academic Honesty Policies, as well as
        the <a target="_blank" href=
        "http://students.msstate.edu/honorcode/">Academic Operating Policy and
        Procedure of Mississippi State University</a>.</p>

        <p>As a professor at Mississippi State University, I am required to
        report all incidents of academic misconduct.</p>

        <h1>Additional Policies</h1>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Grade of Incomplete (I)</span>: Following MSU
        policy, incomplete grades will only be given in extreme circumstances,
        such as illness, death in a student's immediate family, or similar
        circumstances beyond a student's control.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">No Food or Drinks in Class</span>: It is the
        CSE department's policy that you can't eat or dink in Butler hall
        classrooms.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Email</span>: When I send class-related
        email, I will use your <a href=
        "mailto:student_netid@msstate.edu">student_netid@msstate.edu</a> email
        address.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Drop / Add Policy</span>: This class follows
        <a target="_blank" href=
        "http://www.msstate.edu/dept/audit/1201.html">Mississippi State
        University's Official Drop/Add Policy</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>&nbsp;<b>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Add/Drop without penalty</b> - A student
          has through the fifth class day into the semester to drop a course
          and through the sixth class day to add a course without being
          assessed a fee or academic penalty.</p>

          <p><b>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drop after the fifth class day through the 30th
          class day into the semester</b> - A student who elects to drop a
          course during this period must receive the approval of his/her
          advisor, will be assigned a W on his/her academic record, and be
          assessed a fee.&nbsp; The advisor who permits the drop will specify
          its effective date.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><b>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drop after the 30th class day into the
          semester</b> &ndash; A student cannot drop courses after this period
          except in documented cases of serious illness, extreme hardship, or
          failure of the instructor to provide significant assessment of
          his/her performance.&nbsp;&nbsp; A request to drop a course during
          this period must be approved by the student&rsquo;s advisor and
          academic dean.&nbsp; The dean who permits the drop will specify its
          effective date.&nbsp; A student receiving permission to drop will
          receive a W on his/her academic record and be assessed a fee.</p>

          <p><b>D.</b>&nbsp; Faculty are expected to provide a student with
          significant evidence or assessment of his/her class performance
          within the first 30 class days of the semester.</p>
