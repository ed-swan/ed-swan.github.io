          <dt>Course Summary</dt>

          <dd>This course will consist of an intensive study of depth
          perception, with a particular emphasis on how depth perception has
          been measured in virtual environments.&nbsp; We will first examine
          depth perception generally, and discuss the different methods that
          have been developed to measure the perception of depth.&nbsp; We will
          then study how depth perception has been measured in both virtual and
          environments.&nbsp; Generally, we will be interested in two different
          ranges of depth perception: medium-field (~1.5 to ~20 meters) and
          near-field (up to ~ 1 meter; reaching to just beyond reaching
          distance).</dd>

          <dt>Course Objectives</dt>

          <dd>(1) For students to experience deeply and critically reading a
          series of research papers that center on the research topic of depth
          perception in virtual environments.&nbsp;<br>
          (2) For students to develop an understanding of the research
          questions that exist within this research topic, and how each paper
          fits into field's overall scientific effort.<br>
          (3) For students to develop the ability to generalize beyond a
          particular article and develop their own hypothesis and formulate
          their own research questions.</dd>

          <dt>Required Text</dt>

          <dd>There is no required text; instead we will read articles that I
          will place on the MyCourses website.&nbsp; You are expected to read
          these articles before coming to class.&nbsp; This course will require
          a substantial amount of reading and thinking.</dd>

        <h3>Weekly Readings, Questions, and Class Participation</h3>

        <p>For every class meeting, I expect that every student will have read
        all of the articles assigned for that day, and will be prepared to
        critically discuss them.&nbsp; By <i>critically</i>, I mean that you
        should be prepared to <strong>(1) summarize the theoretical questions
        that motivated the work in the article, (2) critique the experiments
        discussed in the article, and (3) evaluate the contribution of the
        findings and the article's general discussion.&nbsp;</strong> Note that
        in class, you need to contribute to the discussion of every article,
        including the articles that you do not present.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>To further motivate you to actually read these articles, we will use
        the Vat Of Doom (VOD) method to run the class discussions.&nbsp; VOD
        has four stages:</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">I. Reading</span>: You will carefully and
        critically read each of the articles that are assigned for the
        class.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">II. Be Prepared to Present the
        Article</span>: For each class, you must be prepared to present a
        summary of each article.&nbsp; This summary should take about 10 to 15
        minutes for a 10-page paper, but could take longer for a review
        paper.&nbsp; Your summary should stimulate class discussion; it should
        not merely be a blow-by-blow description of the article.&nbsp; The
        presenter should be ready to answer the following questions about the
        article: <strong>(1) Why did the authors do what they did?&nbsp; (2)
        What were they testing?&nbsp; (3) What did they do?&nbsp; (4) What did
        they find?&nbsp; (5) What do their results mean?&nbsp; (6) What is your
        opinion of the paper?</strong></p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">III. Submit a Question Before Class</span>:
        You must submit a question for each article.&nbsp; Your question must
        be submitted to me by email by 12pm (noon) of the class day when the
        article will be discussed.&nbsp; These questions should describe some
        aspect of the paper, and then pose a thoughtful discussion question
        about this information.&nbsp; For each question, aim for a length of
        about a quarter of a page (single spaced).</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">IV. The Vat of Doom (VOD)</span>: When we
        meet for class, everyone will have read the papers and submitted
        discussion questions, and we will be ready to explore each paper in
        detail.&nbsp; The power of VOD is that we will draw random names to see
        who will present each article during the class period.&nbsp; The vat of
        doom will be a can that contains everyone's name; as each article is
        encountered we will draw a name at random, and that person will then
        present the article (but see below for an exception).&nbsp; Everyone
        will have one "get out of presenting for free" card, which you can use
        if you don't want to present on that day.&nbsp; However, if you miss
        class for any reason, your missed class will count as your free
        card.</p>

        <h3>Presenting VOD Papers</h3>

        <p>Through VOD, everyone will lead the classroom discussion
        approximately the same number of times over the course of the
        semester.&nbsp; After you present a VOD paper, I will send you written
        feedback regarding your presentation, a grade, and suggestions for
        improvement.&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>Presenting Your Chosen Article</h3>

        <p>Part of the job of conducting science and research is the ability to
        search the literature and find relevant articles.&nbsp; Therefore, each
        of you is required to find an article for a single week at some point
        during the semester.&nbsp; You will sign up for your week during the
        first class period.&nbsp; When your day comes up, you will present your
        chosen article.&nbsp; On that day, your name will not be placed in the
        vat of doom, and so you will only have to be prepared to present your
        own article.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The article that you choose must be relevant to the class, and I
        must approve your article ahead of time.&nbsp; When you find an article
        that you would like to present, send me a PDF version of the article
        and a short explanation of why you have chosen it (about half a page
        single-spaced).&nbsp; If I don't approve it I'll give you some feedback
        on why, and you will need to choose a different article.&nbsp; It is
        your responsibility to find an article and seek approval far enough
        ahead of your presentation date that the article can be posted and your
        classmates can have time to read it before class.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>After you present your chosen article, I will send you the same kind
        of feedback as when you present a VOD paper.</p>

        <h3>Midterm Exam</h3>

        <p>The midterm exam will take place outside of class.&nbsp; I will make
        the exam available online as a MyCourses assignment.&nbsp; The exam
        will consist of essay questions that will require you to analyze
        multiple articles.&nbsp; Any text that you copy from any of the
        articles must be properly cited.&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>Final Exam</h3>

        <p>The final exam will take place during the final exam period, and
        will be in the same format as the midterm exam.</p>

        <h2>Academic Honesty / Misconduct and Collaboration</h2>

        <p>In this course, students are expected to uphold the <a target=
        "_blank" href="http://students.msstate.edu/honorcode/">Mississippi
        State University Honor Code</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"As a Mississippi State University student I will conduct myself
          with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or
          steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do."</p>

          <p>Upon accepting admission to Mississippi State University, a
          student immediately assumes a commitment to uphold the Honor Code, to
          accept responsibility for learning, and to follow the philosophy and
          rules of the Honor Code.&nbsp; Students will be required to state
          their commitment on examinations, research papers, and other academic
          work.&nbsp; Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the
          MSU community from the requirements or the processes of the Honor
          Code.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Students are expected to maintain the standards of academic honesty
        that are described in the <a target="_blank" href=
        "http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/gradstud/honesty.php">CSE
        Department's Graduate Studies Academic Honesty Policy</a>.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>In this class, plagiarism is your biggest danger in terms of
        potentially violating the honor code.&nbsp; At the least, plagiarism,
        even if unintended, on any class assignment will result in a 0 on the
        assignment, and could potentially result in failing the class and even
        getting expelled from the University.&nbsp; So don't do it!&nbsp; If
        you have any doubt, even just a little, about whether something you've
        written might constitute plagiarism, then talk to me about it.</p>

        <p>These are important policies.&nbsp; As a professor at Mississippi
        State University, I am required to report all incidents of academic
        misconduct, and any such incidents will be handled according to the
        <a href="http://www.honorcode.msstate.edu/policy/" target=
        "_blank">Academic Operating Policy and Procedure of Mississippi State
        University</a>.</p>

        <h2>Missed Exams</h2>

        <p>Occasionally students miss examinations.&nbsp; Sometimes the student
        knows about these absences in advance, and sometimes they happen
        unexpectedly.&nbsp; If you know in advance that you will be absent and
        you wish to have the absence considered excused, then you must meet
        with me before the date of the exam, and I will let you know whether or
        not the absence will be excused.&nbsp; If your excused absence will
        occur during an exam, then I will make arrangements for you to take the
        exam early.</p>

        <p>If you miss an exam unexpectedly and wish to have the absence
        considered excused, then you must meet with me at the earliest
        opportunity possible after the absence, and provide documentation to
        support your claim that the absence should be considered excused.&nbsp;
        If the absence is excused, then I will substitute the average number of
        points of your other exams for the missed exam.</p>

        <p>For unexcused absences from examinations you will unfortunately
        receive a score of zero points.</p>

        <h2>Additional Policies</h2>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Attendance and Audits</span>: Attendance is
        required in this class, and as indicated above it will affect your
        grade.&nbsp; Students who are auditing the course must attend at least
        75% of the class meetings in order to receive a passing grade.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Personal Electronic Devices</span>: Students
        must respect their fellow students and not disrupt class. Therefore,
        cell phones, pagers, other such alarms, or personal conversations which
        disturb the lecture are not allowed.&nbsp; Students may bring laptops
        to class; however, laptops are not required for this course.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Grade of Incomplete (I)</span>: Following MSU
        policy, incomplete grades will only be given in extreme circumstances,
        such as illness, death in a student's immediate family, or similar
        circumstances beyond a student's control.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">No Food or Drinks in Class</span>: It is the
        CSE department's policy that you can't eat or dink in Butler hall
        classrooms.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Email</span>: When I send class-related
        email, I will use your <a href=
        "mailto:student_netid@msstate.edu">student_netid@msstate.edu</a> email
        address.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Drop / Add Policy</span>: This class follows
        <a target="_blank" href=
        "http://www.msstate.edu/dept/audit/1201.html">Mississippi State
        University's Official Drop/Add Policy</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><b>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Add/Drop without penalty</b> - A student has
          through the fifth class day into the semester to drop a course and
          through the sixth class day to add a course without being assessed a
          fee or academic penalty.</p>

          <p><b>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drop after the fifth class day through the 30th
          class day into the semester</b> - A student who elects to drop a
          course during this period must receive the approval of his/her
          advisor, will be assigned a W on his/her academic record, and be
          assessed a fee.&nbsp; The advisor who permits the drop will specify
          its effective date.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><b>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drop after the 30th class day into the
          semester</b> &ndash; A student cannot drop courses after this period
          except in documented cases of serious illness, extreme hardship, or
          failure of the instructor to provide significant assessment of
          his/her performance.&nbsp;&nbsp; A request to drop a course during
          this period must be approved by the student&rsquo;s advisor and
          academic dean.&nbsp; The dean who permits the drop will specify its
          effective date.&nbsp; A student receiving permission to drop will
          receive a W on his/her academic record and be assessed a fee.</p>

          <p><b>D.</b>&nbsp; Faculty are expected to provide a student with
          significant evidence or assessment of his/her class performance
          within the first 30 class days of the semester.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Right to Change</h2>

        <p>I reserve the right to change the course policies or schedule in
        order to facilitate instruction. Any such changes will be discussed in
        class and updated on the course web site.</p>
