          <tr>
            <td align="right">Midterm I:</td>

        </table>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Exams</span>: There will be two in-class
        midterm exams during the semester.&nbsp;The final exam will be
        comprehensive, and will be given during the scheduled final exam
        time.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Quizzes</span>: There will be approximately 9
        in-class quizzes, which will be based upon homework problems that are
        assigned for the week.&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Missed Exams</h2>

        <p>Occasionally students miss examinations. Sometimes the student knows
        about these absences in advance, and sometimes they happen
        unexpectedly.&nbsp; If you know in advance that you will be absent and
        you wish to have the absence considered excused, then you must meet
        with me before the date of the exam, and I will let you know whether or
        not the absence will be excused.&nbsp; If your excused absence will
        occur during an exam, then I will make arrangements for you to take the
        exam early.</p>

        <p>If you miss an exam unexpectedly and wish to have the absence
        considered excused, then you must meet with the me at the earliest
        opportunity possible after the absence, and provide documentation to
        support your claim that the absence should be considered excused.&nbsp;
        If the absence is excused, then I will substitute the average grade of
        your other exams (midterms and final) for the missed exam.</p>

        <p>For unexcused absences from examinations you will unfortunately
        receive a score of zero points.</p>

        <h2>Missed Quizzes</h2>

        <p>If you know in advance that you will be absent during a quiz, and
        make prior arrangements with me, then I will substitute the average
        grade of your other quizzes for the missed quiz.&nbsp; Otherwise, a
        missed quiz will result in a grade of zero points.&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Grading and Appeals</h2>

        <p>I will be working with a grader this semester.&nbsp; If you disagree
        with a grade, you need to provide me with a written appeal.&nbsp;
        Although you can discuss a grade with me, I generally won't make a
        decision regarding the grade based on a discussion, but only on a
        written appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Academic Honesty / Misconduct and Collaboration</h2>

        <p>In this course, students are expected to uphold the <a target=
        "_blank" href="http://students.msstate.edu/honorcode/">Mississippi
        State University Honor Code</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"As a Mississippi State University student I will conduct myself
          with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or
          steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do."</p>

          <p>Upon accepting admission to Mississippi State University, a
          student immediately assumes a commitment to uphold the Honor Code, to
          accept responsibility for learning, and to follow the philosophy and
          rules of the Honor Code.&nbsp; Students will be required to state
          their commitment on examinations, research papers, and other academic
          work.&nbsp; Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the
          MSU community from the requirements or the processes of the Honor
          Code.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Students are also expected to maintain the standards of academic
        honesty that are described in the <a href=
        "http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/understud/honesty.php" target=
        "_blank">CSE Department's Undergraduate Studies Academic Honesty
        Policy</a> (CSE 4833), or the <a href=
        "http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/gradstud/honesty.php" target=
        "_blank">CSE Department's Graduate Studies Academic Honesty Policy</a>
        (CSE 6833).&nbsp;</p>

        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>Do not cheat on a quiz or exam.&nbsp;</li>

          <li>Do not turn in someone else's work, on a programming assignment
          or any other type of assignment, as if it were your own.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These are important policies.&nbsp; Not only will violators fail to
        learn the course material, but violators will receive an XF in this
        course, and will otherwise be handled according the CSE Department's
        Undergraduate or Graduate Studies Academic Honesty Policies, as well as
        the <a href="http://www.honorcode.msstate.edu/policy/" target=
        "_blank">Academic Operating Policy and Procedure of Mississippi State
        University</a>.</p>

        <p>As a professor at Mississippi State University, I am required to
        report all incidents of academic misconduct.</p>

        <h2>Additional Policies</h2>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Attendance and Audits</span>: Attendance is
        required in this class.&nbsp; Although attendance will not affect your
        grade, I will take roll, and I will list absences on midterm and final
        grade reports. Students who miss class are still responsible for the
        material covered and for any assignments distributed.&nbsp; Students
        who are auditing the course must attend at least 75% of the class
        meetings in order to receive a passing grade.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Personal Electronic Devices</span>: Students
        must respect their fellow students and not disrupt class. Therefore,
        cell phones, pagers, other such alarms, or personal conversations which
        disturb the lecture are not allowed.&nbsp; Students with personal
        laptops are encouraged to bring them to class; however, laptops are not
        required for this course.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Grade of Incomplete (I)</span>: Following MSU
        policy, incomplete grades will only be given in extreme circumstances,
        such as illness, death in a student's immediate family, or similar
        circumstances beyond a student's control.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">No Food or Drinks in Class</span>: It is the
        CSE department's policy that you can't eat or dink in Butler Hall
        classrooms.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Email</span>: When I send class-related
        email, I will use your <a href=
        "mailto:student_netid@msstate.edu">student_netid@msstate.edu</a> email
        address.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Drop / Add Policy</span>: This class follows
        <a target="_blank" href=
        "http://www.msstate.edu/dept/audit/1201.html">Mississippi State
        University's Official Drop/Add Policy</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><b>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Add/Drop without penalty</b> &mdash; A student
          has through the fifth class day into the semester to drop a course
          and through the sixth class day to add a course without being
          assessed a fee or academic penalty.</p>

          <p><b>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drop after the fifth class day through the 30th
          class day into the semester</b> &mdash; A student who elects to drop
          a course during this period must receive the approval of his/her
          advisor, will be assigned a W on his/her academic record, and be
          assessed a fee.&nbsp; The advisor who permits the drop will specify
          its effective date.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><b>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drop after the 30th class day into the
          semester</b> &mdash; A student cannot drop courses after this period
          except in documented cases of serious illness, extreme hardship, or
          failure of the instructor to provide significant assessment of
          his/her performance.&nbsp;&nbsp; A request to drop a course during
          this period must be approved by the student&rsquo;s advisor and
          academic dean.&nbsp; The dean who permits the drop will specify its
          effective date.&nbsp; A student receiving permission to drop will
          receive a W on his/her academic record and be assessed a fee.</p>

          <p><b>D.</b>&nbsp; Faculty are expected to provide a student with
          significant evidence or assessment of his/her class performance
          within the first 30 class days of the semester.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Right to Change</h2>

        <p>I reserve the right to change the course policies or schedule in
        order to facilitate instruction. Any such changes will be discussed in
        class and updated on the course web site.</p>
