<p><u><b>Exams</b></u>: We will have two examinations during the semester; each 
will be worth 100 points.</p>
<p><u><b>Homework Assignments</b></u>: We will have a number (6 – 10) of 
homework assignments during the semester.&nbsp; Most of the questions will be 
chosen from the exercises given at the end of each chapter in our textbook.&nbsp; 
Some homework assignments may be programming assignments.&nbsp; For the homework 
assignments, students taking CSE 6833 will generally have several extra 
questions to answer; students taking CSE 4833 will not be required to answer 
these extra questions.&nbsp; As described under the section on
<a href="#Collaboration">Collaboration</a> below, I allow a greater degree of 
collaboration on homework assignments than is allowed under the strictest 
possible interpretation of the
<a href="http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/honesty.php">CSE Department's 
Academic Honesty Policy</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Homework assignments will be due at the beginning of the class period; 
homework turned in after this time will be considered late.&nbsp; If a homework 
assignment is turned in during the first 24 hour period after it is due, that 
assignment will be given 50% of its final grade.&nbsp; Homework assignments 
turned in more than 24 hours late will receive 0 points.&nbsp; For example, a 
homework which receives a grade of 80 out of 100 will be recorded as &quot;80&quot; if it 
is turned in on time, will be recorded as &quot;40&quot; if it is turned in up to 24 hours 
late, and will be recorded as &quot;0&quot; thereafter.&nbsp; If you submit a late 
assignment, turn it in to the secretary in Butler 300; do not turn it in to me 
or slip it under my door.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You should take the homework assignments seriously --- they are the best way 
to learn the material in this course.&nbsp; If you cannot complete a homework 
assignment in time, turn it in late, both to collect some points and to further 
study and learn the material!</p>
<p><u><b>Quizzes</b></u>: We will have a number (6 – 10) of quizzes during the 
semester; they will be given during random class meetings. Quizzes will 
generally be worth 10 to 15 points, and will generally cover the class material 
since the previous quiz.&nbsp; </p>
<p><u><b>Final Exam</b></u>: Our final exam will be given during the scheduled 
final exam time, and will be worth 100 points.</p>
<h1>Grading and Appeals</h1>
<p>I will be working with a grader to grade your homework assignments, exams, 
quizzes, and / or final exam.&nbsp; If you disagree with a grade, you need to 
provide me with a written appeal.&nbsp; Although you can discuss a grade with 
me, I won't make a decision regarding the grade based on a discussion, but only 
on a written appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h1>The WebCT Message Boards and Email</h1>
<p>In this class, the WebCT message boards are the main communication interface 
between the instructor, the grader, and your fellow students. Do not send email 
to the instructor with questions about assignments; post these to the discussion 
boards instead. Often, other students may be able to answer your question before 
the instructor.&nbsp; My goal is for the course to build upon a collaborative 
environment.</p>
<p>Since there may be frequent list activity, check the boards at least once a 
day. Students are responsible for knowing any material posted by the instructor.</p>
<p>The boards are a forum for discussion related to this class. Therefore, do 
not post rude or irrelevant messages. In addition, while general approaches can 
be discussed, exact or partial solutions (including code detailed snippets) are 
not allowed. Everyone is to do their own work.</p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="Collaboration">Academic Honesty / 
Misconduct and Collaboration</a></span></h1>
<p>Students are expected to maintain the standards of academic honesty that are 
described in the <a href="http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/honesty.php">
Department of Computer Science and Engineering's Academic Honesty Policy</a>.&nbsp; 
These standards apply in their entirety to <b>exams</b>, <b>quizzes</b>, and the
<b>final exam</b>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>However, in the real world people work in groups.&nbsp; I encourage students 
to collaborate on <b>homework assignments</b> in terms of <i>discussing general 
approaches</i>.&nbsp; Students may also assist each other in <i>algorithm 
debugging</i>. Students may engage in these activities through the message 
boards.&nbsp; However, <i>the solution for each assignment must be written 
individually by each student</i>. This means do not turn in answers downloaded 
off the Internet or accessed by other means. Do not turn in someone else's work 
as if it were your own.&nbsp; This is an important policy.&nbsp; Not only will 
violators fail to learn the course material, but violators of this policy will 
receive an &quot;F&quot; in this course, and will otherwise be handled according the
<a href="http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/honesty.php">Academic Honesty 
Policy</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<h1>Missed Quizzes and Exams</h1>
<p>Occasionally students miss examinations and quizzes. Sometimes the student 
knows about these absences in advance, and sometimes they happen unexpectedly.&nbsp; 
If you know in advance that you will be absent and you wish to have the absence 
considered excused, then you must meet with me before the date of the quiz or 
exam, and I will let you know whether or not the absence will be excused.&nbsp; 
If your excused absence will occur during an exam, then I will make arrangements 
for you to take the exam early. If a quiz is given during an excused absence, 
then I will substitute the average number of points of your other quizzes for 
the missed quiz. </p>
<p>If you miss a quiz or exam unexpectedly and wish to have the absence 
considered excused, then you must meet with the me at the earliest opportunity 
possible after the absence, and provide documentation to support your claim that 
the absence should be considered excused. If the absence is excused, then I will 
substitute the average number of points of your other quizzes or exams for the 
missed quiz or exam.</p>
<p align="left">For unexcused absences from examinations or quizzes you will 
unfortunately receive a score of zero points.</p>
<h1>Additional Policies</h1>
<p><b>Attendance and Audits</b>: Attendance is required in this class...I will 
take roll, and I will list absences on midterm and final grade reports. Students 
who miss class are still responsible for the material covered and for any 
assignments distributed.&nbsp; Students who are auditing the course must attend 
at least 75% of the class meetings in order to receive a passing grade.</p>
<p><b>Personal Electronic Devices</b>: Students must respect their fellow 
students and not disrupt class. Therefore, cell phones, pagers, other such 
alarms, or personal conversations which disturb the lecture are not allowed.&nbsp; 
Students with personal laptops are encouraged to bring them to class; however, 
laptops are not required for this course.</p>
<p><b>Grade of Incomplete (I)</b>: Incomplete grades will only be given in 
extreme circumstances, such as illness, death in a student's immediate family, 
or similar circumstances beyond a student's control. </p>
<p><b>No Food or Drinks in Class</b>: It is the CSE department's policy that you 
can't eat or dink in Butler 100. </p>
<p><b>Drop / Add Policy</b>: This class follows
<a href="http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/add_drop.php">Mississippi State 
University's Official Drop/Add Policy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Add/drop without penalty</b>: A student has through the fifth class day 
  into the semester to add a course and through the tenth class day to drop a 
  course without being assessed a fee or academic penalty. </p>
  <p><b>Drop after the tenth class day through the 30th class day into the 
  semester</b>: A student who elects to drop a course during this period must 
  receive the approval of his/her advisor, will be assigned a W on his/her 
  academic record, and be assessed a fee. The advisor who permits the drop will 
  specify its effective date.</p>
  <p><b>Drop after the 30th class day into the semester</b>: A student cannot 
  drop courses after this period except in documented cases of serious illness, 
  extreme hardship, or failure of the instructor to provide significant 
  assessment of his/her performance. A request to drop a course during this 
  period must be approved by the student's advisor and academic dean. The dean 
  who permits the drop will specify its effective date. A student receiving 
  permission to drop will receive a W on his/her academic record and be assessed 
  a fee. </p>
  <p>Faculty are expected to provide a student with significant evidence or 
  assessment of his/her class performance within the first six weeks. </p>
