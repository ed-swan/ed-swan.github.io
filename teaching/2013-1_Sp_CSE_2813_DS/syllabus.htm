        <h2>Graded Activities</h2>

        <table class="centered" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="3">
          <tr>
            <td align="right">Midterm I:</td>

            <td>20%</td>
          </tr>

            <td align="right">Class Participation:</td>

            <td>5%</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Exams</span>: There will be two in-class 
		midterm exams during the semester.&nbsp; The final exam will be 
		comprehensive, and will be given during the scheduled final exam time.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Quizzes</span>: There will be approximately 8 
		to 9 
		in-class quizzes, which will be based upon homework problems that are 
		assigned for the week.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Class Participation</span>: The class 
		participation grade is calculated as <i>g</i> = 0.05*(<i>n</i> &ndash;
		<i>a</i>)<i>/n</i>, where <i>g</i> is the class participation 
		grade, <i>n</i> is the number of days on which attendance is taken, and
		<i>a</i> is the number of absences.&nbsp; Note that, although attendance 
		will be taken on most days, it will not be taken every day.&nbsp; If you 
		are absent and do not want the absence to affect your class 
		participation grade, discuss the absence with me.&nbsp; If I judge the 
		absence to be excused, then I will reduce <i>n</i> for you by one, which 
		means that the absence will not affect your class participation grade.&nbsp; </p>
		<h2>Honors Credit</h2>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Enrollment</span>: Students taking the class
        for honors credit will have to enroll in the honors
        sections.&nbsp; After the last day to add a class, a student enrolled
        in an honors section cannot change to a non-honors section and
        vice-versa.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Honors Project</span>: Honors students will
        complete an independent project in addition to the regular class
        work.&nbsp; I must approve the project before the work commences, 
		so talk to me first.&nbsp; The textbook suggests many interesting 
		projects.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Honors Grading</span>: For the honors
        students, the honors project will count for 10% of the overall grade,
        while the remaining 90% of the grade will be calculated as described
        above.&nbsp; Note that failing to submit an honors project will result
        in a grade of 0 for the honors portion of the grade, which could drop
        the overall average by a letter grade.</p>

          <h2>Missed Exams</h2>

          <p>Occasionally students miss examinations. Sometimes the student 
		  knows about these absences in advance, and sometimes they happen 
		  unexpectedly.&nbsp; If you know in advance that you will be absent and 
		  you wish to have the absence considered excused, then you must meet 
		  with me before the date of the exam, and I will let you know whether 
		  or not the absence will be excused.&nbsp; If your excused absence will 
		  occur during an exam, then I will make arrangements for you to take 
		  the exam early.</p>
		  <p>If you miss an exam unexpectedly and wish to have the absence 
		  considered excused, then you must meet with the me at the earliest 
		  opportunity possible after the absence, and provide documentation to 
		  support your claim that the absence should be considered excused.&nbsp; 
		  If the absence is excused, then I will substitute the average grade of 
		  your other exams (midterms and final) for the missed exam.</p>
		  <p>For unexcused absences from examinations you will unfortunately 
		  receive a score of zero points.</p>
		  <h2>Missed Quizzes</h2>
		  <p>If you know in advance that you will be absent during a quiz, and 
		  make prior arrangements with me, then your missed quiz will not count 
		  towards your final course grade.&nbsp; Otherwise, a missed quiz will 
		  result in a grade of zero points.&nbsp;</p>
		  <h2>Grading and Appeals</h2>

        <p>I will be working with a grader this semester.&nbsp; If you
        disagree with a grade, you need to provide me with a written
        appeal.&nbsp; Although you can discuss a grade with me, I generally
        won't make a decision regarding the grade based on a discussion, but
        only on a written appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Academic Honesty and Misconduct</h2>

        <p>In this course, students are expected to uphold the <a target=
        "_blank" href="http://students.msstate.edu/honorcode/">Mississippi
        State University Honor Code</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"As a Mississippi State University student I will conduct myself
          with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or
          steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do."</p>

          <p>Upon accepting admission to Mississippi State University, a
          student immediately assumes a commitment to uphold the Honor Code, to
          accept responsibility for learning, and to follow the philosophy and
          rules of the Honor Code.&nbsp; Students will be required to state
          their commitment on examinations, research papers, and other academic
          work.&nbsp; Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the
          MSU community from the requirements or the processes of the Honor
          Code.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Students are also expected to maintain the standards of academic
        honesty that are described in the <a target="_blank" href=
        "http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/understud/honesty.php">CSE
        Department's Undergraduate Studies Academic Honesty Policy</a>.</p>

        <ul class="bullet">
          <li>Do not cheat on a quiz or exam.&nbsp;</li>

          <li>Do not turn in someone else's work, on a programming assignment
          or any other type of assignment, as if it were your own.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This are important policies.&nbsp; Not only will violators fail to
        learn the course material, but violators will receive an XF in this
        course, and will otherwise be handled according the CSE Department's
        Undergraduate or Graduate Studies Academic Honesty Policies, as well as
        the <a href="http://www.honorcode.msstate.edu/policy/" target="_blank">Academic Operating Policy and
        Procedure of Mississippi State University</a>.</p>

        <p>As a professor at Mississippi State University, I am required to
        report all incidents of academic misconduct.</p>

        <h2>Additional Policies</h2>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Attendance and Audits</span>: I will list 
		absences on midterm and final grade reports.&nbsp; Students who miss 
		class are responsible for the material covered and for any assignments 
		distributed.&nbsp; Students who are
        auditing the course must attend at least 75% of the class meetings in
        order to receive a passing grade.</p>
		<p><span class="parlabel">Personal Electronic Devices</span>: Students
        must respect their fellow students and not disrupt class. Therefore,
        cell phones, pagers, other such alarms, or personal conversations which
        disturb the lecture are not allowed.&nbsp; Students with personal 
		laptops are encouraged to bring them to class; however, laptops are not 
		required for this course.</p>
		  <p><span class="parlabel">Grade of Incomplete (I)</span>: Following MSU
        policy, incomplete grades will only be given in extreme circumstances,
        such as illness, death in a student's immediate family, or similar
        circumstances beyond a student's control.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">No Food or Drinks in Class</span>: It is the
        CSE department's policy that you can't eat or dink in Butler hall
        classrooms.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Email</span>: When I send class-related
        email, I will use your <a href=
        "mailto:student_netid@msstate.edu">student_netid@msstate.edu</a> email
        address.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Drop / Add Policy</span>: This class follows
        <a target="_blank" href=
        "http://www.msstate.edu/dept/audit/1201.html">Mississippi State
        University's Official Drop/Add Policy</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><b>Add/drop without penalty</b>: A student has through the fifth
          class day into the semester to add a course and through the tenth
          class day to drop a course without being assessed a fee or academic
          penalty.</p>

          <p><b>Drop after the tenth class day through the 30th class day into
          the semester</b>: A student who elects to drop a course during this
          period must receive the approval of his/her advisor, will be assigned
          a W on his/her academic record, and be assessed a fee. The advisor
          who permits the drop will specify its effective date.</p>

          <p><b>Drop after the 30th class day into the semester</b>: A student
          cannot drop courses after this period except in documented cases of
          serious illness, extreme hardship, or failure of the instructor to
          provide significant assessment of his/her performance. A request to
          drop a course during this period must be approved by the student's
          advisor and academic dean. The dean who permits the drop will specify
          its effective date. A student receiving permission to drop will
          receive a W on his/her academic record and be assessed a fee.</p>

          <p>Faculty are expected to provide a student with significant
          evidence or assessment of his/her class performance within the first
          30 days of the semester.</p>
        </blockquote>
		<h2>Right to Change</h2>
		<p>I reserve the right to change the course policies or schedule in 
		order to facilitate instruction.&nbsp; Any such changes will be 
		discussed in class and updated on the course web site.</p>
