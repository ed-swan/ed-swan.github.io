        <p><span class="parlabel">Group Design Projects</span>: The primary
        activity of this class will be collaboratively developing a series of
        user interface designs in an interdisciplinary small team format.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Class Presentations and Assignments</span>:
        Students will make class presentations, and may complete additional
        assignments.&nbsp; The class presentations will primarily involve
        demonstrating and analyzing user interfaces and interaction
        techniques.&nbsp; Assignments may be in-class or take-home
        (homework).&nbsp; In-class activities will have either a written
        component for students to prepare individually in advance, or a group
        assignment to be done in class.&nbsp; Take-home assignments are due by
        class time on the due date; they will not be accepted after the
        beginning of class.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Mid-term Exam</span>: There will be one
        in-class test near the middle of the semester.&nbsp; The test will
        consist of short answer and essay questions.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Final Exam</span>: The final exam will have
        the same format as the mid-term, and will be non-cumulative, covering
        only material from the second half of the semester.</p>

        <h1>Group Design Projects</h1>

        <p>In this class, students will spend the majority of their time
        designing and implementing user interface designs.&nbsp; This will
        occur in small teams of students; we will aim for team sizes of
        2&ndash;5 members.&nbsp; Students will be randomly assigned to
        teams.&nbsp; We will have 3&ndash;4 design projects this
        semester.&nbsp; After each project, teams will disband and new teams
        will be formed.</p>

        <p>During the design process, teams will present periodic progress
        reports in class.&nbsp; On the day a design is due, teams will present
        their design to the class, and will turn in materials (drawings,
        mockups, slides, documents, source code, etc.) related to the
        design.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Grading</span>: I will subjectively grade the
        interface designs.&nbsp; The primary grading criteria will be the
        degree to which the design meets its assigned objectives.&nbsp;
        Additional criteria may include evidence of how much effort the team
        has invested in the design, creativity, and the quality of submitted
        materials.&nbsp; The result of this grading process will be a <em>team
        grade</em>.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The baseline grade for each team member will be equal to the team
        grade, but may be modified up or down based on <em>peer feedback</em>
        and <em>instructor feedback</em>.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Peer and Instructor Feedback</span>: After
        each design is completed, team members will be asked to anonymously
        evaluate each other along dimensions related to contribution level and
        how easy they are to work with.&nbsp; A team member's grade may be
        modified either up or down by this feedback.&nbsp; Each team member
        will receive an anonymized version of this feedback.&nbsp; In addition,
        I may further adjust a team member's grade up or down, based on my
        observation of the team member's contribution level, both to the
        development of the interface design as well as to the class as a
        whole.&nbsp; I will communicate any such grade adjustment to each
        affected student.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Peer and Instructor Feedback may adjust a team member's grade up or
        down by at most two letter grades (20% of the total points the design
        is worth).&nbsp;</p>

        <h1>Missed Exams</h1>

        <p>Occasionally students miss examinations.&nbsp; Sometimes the student
        knows about these absences in advance, and sometimes they happen
        unexpectedly.&nbsp; If you know in advance that you will be absent and
        you wish to have the absence considered excused, then you must meet
        with me before the date of the exam, and I will let you know whether or
        not the absence will be excused.&nbsp; If your excused absence will
        occur during an exam, then I will make arrangements for you to take the
        exam early.</p>

        <p>If you miss an exam unexpectedly and wish to have the absence
        considered excused, then you must meet with the me at the earliest
        opportunity possible after the absence, and provide documentation to
        support your claim that the absence should be considered excused.&nbsp;
        If the absence is excused, then I will substitute the average number of
        points of your other exams for the missed exam.</p>

        <p>For unexcused absences from examinations you will unfortunately
        receive a score of zero points.</p>

        <h1>Academic Honesty / Misconduct and Collaboration</h1>

        <p>In this course, students are expected to uphold the <a target=
        "_blank" href="http://students.msstate.edu/honorcode/">Mississippi
        State University Honor Code</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"As a Mississippi State University student I will conduct myself
          with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or
          steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do."</p>

          <p>Upon accepting admission to Mississippi State University, a
          student immediately assumes a commitment to uphold the Honor Code, to
          accept responsibility for learning, and to follow the philosophy and
          rules of the Honor Code.&nbsp; Students will be required to state
          their commitment on examinations, research papers, and other academic
          work.&nbsp; Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the
          MSU community from the requirements or the processes of the Honor
          Code.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Students are also expected to maintain the standards of academic
        honesty that are described in the <a target="_blank" href=
        "http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/understud/honesty.php">CSE
        Department's Undergraduate Studies Academic Honesty Policy</a> (CSE
        4663), or the <a target="_blank" href=
        "http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/gradstud/honesty.php">CSE
        Department's Graduate Studies Academic Honesty Policy</a> (CSE
        6663).&nbsp;</p>

        <p>All work on homework assignments and exams is to be your own.&nbsp;
        Projects are to be completed by the members of the project group.&nbsp;
        Project reports should provide full citations for any sources
        (including articles, books, websites, etc.).&nbsp; Plagiarism is
        strictly prohibited.&nbsp; Do not turn in someone else's work as if it
        were your own.&nbsp; This are important policies.&nbsp; Not only will
        violators fail to learn the course material, but violators will receive
        an "XF" in this course, and will otherwise be handled according the CSE
        Department's Undergraduate or Graduate Studies Academic Honesty
        Policies, as well as the <a target="_blank" href=
        "http://students.msstate.edu/honorcode/">Academic Operating Policy and
        Procedure of Mississippi State University</a>.</p>

        <h1>Additional Policies</h1>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Attendance and Audits</span>: Attendance is
        required in this class.&nbsp; Although attendance will not directly
        affect your grade, I will take roll, and I will list absences on
        midterm and final grade reports.&nbsp; Students who miss class are
        still responsible for the material covered and for any assignments
        distributed.&nbsp; Furthermore, as described above, students who are
        absent for an in-class group activity will not receive any credit for
        that activity.&nbsp; Students who are auditing the course must attend
        at least 75% of the class meetings in order to receive a passing
        grade.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Personal Electronic Devices</span>: Students
        must respect their fellow students and not disrupt class. Therefore,
        cell phones, pagers, other such alarms, or personal conversations which
        disturb the lecture are not allowed.&nbsp; Students with personal
        laptops are encouraged to bring them to class; however, laptops are not
        required for this course.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Grade of Incomplete (I)</span>: Incomplete
        grades will only be given in extreme circumstances, such as illness,
        death in a student's immediate family, or similar circumstances beyond
        a student's control.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">No Food or Drinks in Class</span>: It is the
        CSE department's policy that you can't eat or dink in Butler 100.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Drop / Add Policy</span>: This class follows
        <a target="_blank" href=
        "http://www.msstate.edu/dept/audit/1201.html">Mississippi State
        University's Official Drop/Add Policy</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><b>Add/drop without penalty</b>: A student has through the fifth
          class day into the semester to add a course and through the tenth
          class day to drop a course without being assessed a fee or academic
          penalty.</p>

          <p><b>Drop after the tenth class day through the 30th class day into
          the semester</b>: A student who elects to drop a course during this
          period must receive the approval of his/her advisor, will be assigned
          a W on his/her academic record, and be assessed a fee. The advisor
          who permits the drop will specify its effective date.</p>

          <p><b>Drop after the 30th class day into the semester</b>: A student
          cannot drop courses after this period except in documented cases of
          serious illness, extreme hardship, or failure of the instructor to
          provide significant assessment of his/her performance. A request to
          drop a course during this period must be approved by the student's
          advisor and academic dean. The dean who permits the drop will specify
          its effective date. A student receiving permission to drop will
          receive a W on his/her academic record and be assessed a fee.</p>

          <p>Faculty are expected to provide a student with significant
          evidence or assessment of his/her class performance within the first
          30 days of the semester.</p>
