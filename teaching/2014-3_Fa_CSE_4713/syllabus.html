          <p><span class="parlabel">In-Class Activities</span>: These will be
          short 10 to 15-minute activities, such as quizzes and perhaps group
          work.&nbsp; It is your responsibility to be in class to complete
          these in-class activities.<br></p>

          <p><span class="parlabel">Programming Projects</span>: These projects
          will come from the textbook and perhaps other sources.&nbsp;
          Graduate-level assignments may be more complex than the
          undergraduate-level assignments.</p>

          <p><span class="parlabel">Exams</span>: There will be two in-class
          midterm exams during the semester.&nbsp; The final exam will be
          comprehensive, and will be given during the scheduled final exam
          time.&nbsp; The graduate level exams will reflect the deeper
          understanding of the material that is required for graduate
          credit.<br></p>

          <p><span class="parlabel">Term Paper</span>: Students taking this
          course for graduate credit are required to write a term paper
          surveying an area of emerging languages or compiler technology and
          research; some example topics include secure languages, automatic
          parallelism extraction, hardware development languages, and languages
          for alternative hardware such as GPUs.&nbsp; This paper should have
          12 double-spaced pages (not counting the title page and references),
          with 1-inch margins, and 12 point font.</p>

          <h2>Attendance</h2>

          <p>I expect you to attend the class meetings.&nbsp; While I may or
          may not take attendance, we will often have in-class activities that
          count towards the <i>In Class Activities</i> portion of your
          grade.&nbsp; <u>If you are absent, you will receive a zero for the
          day's activity</u>.&nbsp; If you know in advance that you will be
          absent, and if I approve the absence, then your missed activity will
          not count towards your final course grade.&nbsp; Otherwise, a missed
          activity will result in a grade of zero points.<br></p>

          <p>Keep in mind that if you are absent you are still responsible for
          material covered in class.&nbsp; Therefore, absences may have an
          indirect effect on other parts of your grade.&nbsp; If you miss
          class, it is your responsibility to talk with <u>another student</u>
          to determine what was covered in lecture.&nbsp; Numerous research
          studies have shown that grades and attendance are highly correlated,
          and in my decades of college teaching I have seen the truth of this
          correlation again and again &mdash; <u>showing up is the
          number one thing you can do</u> for your final grade in this class
          and in all of your classes.&nbsp;<br></p>

          <p>Students who are auditing the course must attend at least 75% of
          the class meetings in order to receive a passing grade.</p>

          <h2>Late Assignments</h2>

          <p>Deadlines are deadlines.&nbsp; Late assignments will receive
          penalties.&nbsp; Please plan ahead and don't put off getting
          started.<br>
          <br>
          All out-of-class assignments are due at the beginning of class on the
          due date.&nbsp; Any assignment turned in after this deadline is
          considered late.&nbsp; Late assignments will lose 10% of the final
          grade for every 24-hour period, up to a maximum of 100%, where
          weekends count as one 24-hour period.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          All assignments must be submitted in order to pass the course, even
          if the assignment will receive no credit.&nbsp; A student who fails
          to submit any assignment will receive an 'F' grade, regardless of any
          other achievements in the class.&nbsp; The last day for submitting
          assignments is the last lecture day for this course before the final
          exam.&nbsp; An assignment submission will only be considered valid if
          it suggests that the student has made a good-faith effort to complete
          the assignment; this will be determined by the professor on an
          individual basis.&nbsp; For example, a program with incomplete
          functionality will typically not be accepted.<br>
          <br>
          In the case of extenuating circumstances where an extension is
          requested, the student must supply official documentation.&nbsp; For
          example, family or personal crises documentation can be obtained from
          the Dean of Students Office, while health-related documentation can
          be obtained from the Health Center.&nbsp; Documentation and any
          approved late work should be turned in to the professor no later than
          one week after the extenuating circumstance occurs.<br></p>

          <h2>Missed Exams</h2>

          <p>Occasionally students miss examinations. Sometimes the student
          knows about these absences in advance, and sometimes they happen
          unexpectedly.&nbsp; If you know in advance that you will be absent
          and you wish to have the absence considered excused, then you must
          meet with me before the date of the exam, and I will let you know
          whether or not the absence will be excused.&nbsp; If your excused
          absence will occur during an exam, then I will make arrangements for
          you to take the exam early.</p>

          <p>If you miss an exam unexpectedly and wish to have the absence
          considered excused, then you must meet with the me at the earliest
          opportunity possible after the absence, and provide documentation to
          support your claim that the absence should be considered
          excused.&nbsp; If the absence is excused, then I will substitute the
          average grade of your other exams (midterms and final) for the missed
          exam.</p>

          <p>For unexcused absences from examinations you will receive a score
          of zero points.</p>

          <h2>Grading and Appeals</h2>

          <p>I will be working with a grader &mdash; the Project Instructor
          &mdash; this semester.&nbsp; If you disagree with a grade, you need
          to provide me with a written appeal.&nbsp; Although you can discuss a
          grade with me, I generally won't make a decision regarding the grade
          based on a discussion, but only on a written
          appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Course Communication</h2>

          <p><span class="parlabel">Website</span>: We will use the myCourses
          website for this class.&nbsp; The myCourses page will be updated
          often, especially when assignments are posted.&nbsp; Assignments will
          be submitted electronically through myCourses.<br></p>

          <p><span class="parlabel">Email</span>: When I send class-related
          email, I will use your <a href=
          "mailto:student_netid@msstate.edu">student_netid@msstate.edu</a>
          email address.&nbsp; Unless otherwise instructed, do not send email
          asking the professor or project instructor to debug a program.&nbsp;
          If you need help, come by during office hours or set up an
          appointment.<br></p>

          <h2>Academic Honesty and Misconduct</h2>

          <p>In this course, students are expected to uphold the <a target=
          "_blank" href="http://students.msstate.edu/honorcode/">Mississippi
          State University Honor Code</a>:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>"As a Mississippi State University student I will conduct myself
            with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or
            steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do."</p>

            <p>Upon accepting admission to Mississippi State University, a
            student immediately assumes a commitment to uphold the Honor Code,
            to accept responsibility for learning, and to follow the philosophy
            and rules of the Honor Code.&nbsp; Students will be required to
            state their commitment on examinations, research papers, and other
            academic work.&nbsp; Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any
            member of the MSU community from the requirements or the processes
            of the Honor Code.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Students are also expected to maintain the standards of academic
          honesty that are described in the <a href=
          "http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/understud/honesty.php">CSE
          Department's Undergraduate Studies Academic Honesty Policy</a> (CSE
          4713), or the <a href=
          "http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/gradstud/honesty.php">CSE
          Department's Graduate Studies Academic Honesty Policy</a> (CSE
          6713).&nbsp;<br>
          There will be no tolerance for any form of academic dishonesty.&nbsp;
          In particular:<br></p>

          <ul class="bullet">
            <li>Do not cheat on a quiz or exam.&nbsp;</li>

            <li>Do not turn in someone else's work, on a programming assignment
            or any other type of assignment, as if it were your own.&nbsp;</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This are important policies.&nbsp; Not only will violators fail to
          learn the course material, but violators will receive an XF in this
          course, and will otherwise be handled according the CSE Department's
          Undergraduate or Graduate Studies Academic Honesty Policies, as well
          as the <a href="http://www.honorcode.msstate.edu/policy/" target=
          "_blank">Academic Operating Policy and Procedure of Mississippi State
          University</a>.</p>

          <p>As a professor at Mississippi State University, I am required to
          report all incidents of academic misconduct.&nbsp;<br></p>

          <h2>Additional Policies</h2>

          <p><span class="parlabel">Personal Electronic Devices</span>:
          Students must respect their fellow students and not disrupt
          class.&nbsp; Therefore, cell phones, pagers, other such alarms, or
          personal conversations which disturb the lecture are not
          allowed.&nbsp; It is very unprofessional for your mobile phone to
          make noise during our time together.&nbsp; Remove any headsets or
          earbuds before coming to class.&nbsp; Students with personal laptops
          are encouraged to bring them to class; however, laptops are not
          required for this course.</p>

          <p><span class="parlabel">Grade of Incomplete (I)</span>: Following
          MSU policy, incomplete grades will only be given in extreme
          circumstances, such as serious medical events, a death in a student's
          immediate family, or similar circumstances beyond a student's
          control.</p>

          <p><span class="parlabel">No Food or Drinks in Class</span>: It is
          the CSE department's policy that you can't eat or dink in Butler hall
          classrooms.</p>

          <p><span class="parlabel">Drop / Add Policy</span>: This class
          follows <a target="_blank" href=
          "http://www.msstate.edu/dept/audit/1201.html">Mississippi State
          University's Official Drop/Add Policy</a>:</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p><b>Add/drop without penalty</b>: A student has through the fifth
            class day into the semester to add a course and through the tenth
            class day to drop a course without being assessed a fee or academic
            penalty.</p>

            <p><b>Drop after the tenth class day through the 30th class day
            into the semester</b>: A student who elects to drop a course during
            this period must receive the approval of his/her advisor, will be
            assigned a W on his/her academic record, and be assessed a fee. The
            advisor who permits the drop will specify its effective date.</p>

            <p><b>Drop after the 30th class day into the semester</b>: A
            student cannot drop courses after this period except in documented
            cases of serious illness, extreme hardship, or failure of the
            instructor to provide significant assessment of his/her
            performance. A request to drop a course during this period must be
            approved by the student's advisor and academic dean. The dean who
            permits the drop will specify its effective date. A student
            receiving permission to drop will receive a W on his/her academic
            record and be assessed a fee.</p>

            <p>Faculty are expected to provide a student with significant
            evidence or assessment of his/her class performance within the
            first 30 days of the semester.</p>
          </blockquote>

          <h2>Right to Change</h2>

          <p>I reserve the right to change the course policies or schedule in
          order to facilitate instruction.&nbsp; Any such changes will be
          discussed in class and updated on the course web site.</p>
