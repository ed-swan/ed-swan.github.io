<p><span class="parlabel">Games</span>: The primary activity of this class will be 
collaboratively developing three games in an interdisciplinary small team 
format.&nbsp; </p>
<p><span class="parlabel">Class Presentations and Assignments</span>: Students will make 
class presentations, and may complete additional assignments.&nbsp; 
The class presentations will primarily involve demonstrating and analyzing existing computer 
games, but they may also involve presenting various game design topics.
<p><span class="parlabel">Midterm</span>: We will have one open-book, open-internet midterm 
exam, which will consist of typed essay questions.&nbsp; It may also involve 
analyzing and critiquing a game, using analytical concepts discussed in class.</p>
<p><span class="parlabel">Final Exam</span>: Our final exam will be similar in format to the 
midterm exam.</p>
<h1>Game Design Assignments</h1>
<p>In this class, students will spend the majority of their time designing and 
implementing computer games.&nbsp; This will occur in small teams of students; 
we will aim for team sizes of 2&ndash;5 members.&nbsp; Students will be randomly 
assigned to teams.&nbsp; We will design three games; after each game, teams will 
disband and new teams will be formed.</p>
<p>During the design process, teams will present periodic progress reports in 
class.&nbsp; On the day a game is due, teams will present their game to the 
class, and will turn in source code and other materials related to the game.&nbsp; 
Teams may be required to turn in game-related documentation as well.</p>
<p><span class="parlabel">Grading</span>: I will subjectively grade the games.&nbsp; 
The primary grading criteria will be the degree to which the game meets its 
assigned objectives.&nbsp; Additional criteria may include evidence of how much 
effort the team has invested in the game, creativity, and the quality of 
submitted materials such as code, design documents, concept drawings, research 
results, etc.&nbsp; The result of this grading process will be a <em>team grade</em>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The baseline grade for each team member will be equal to the team grade, but 
may be modified up or down based on <em>peer feedback </em>and <em>instructor 
feedback</em>.&nbsp; </p>
<p><span class="parlabel">Peer and Instructor Feedback</span>: After each game 
is completed, team members will be asked to anonymously evaluate each other 
along dimensions related to contribution level and how easy they are to work 
with.&nbsp; A team member&#39;s grade may be modified either up or down by this 
feedback.&nbsp; Each team member will receive an anonymized version of this 
feedback.&nbsp; In addition, I may further adjust a team member&#39;s grade up or 
down, based on my observation of the team member&#39;s contribution level, both to 
the development of the game as well as to the class as a whole.&nbsp; I will 
communicate any such grade adjustment to each affected student.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Peer and Instructor Feedback may adjust a team member&#39;s grade up or down by 
at most one letter grade (10% of the total points the game is worth).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h1>Missed Exams</h1>
<p>Occasionally students miss examinations. Sometimes the student knows about 
these absences in advance, and sometimes they happen unexpectedly.&nbsp; If you 
know in advance that you will be absent and you wish to have the absence 
considered excused, then you must meet with me before the date of the exam, and 
I will let you know whether or not the absence will be excused.&nbsp; If your 
excused absence will occur during an exam, then I will make arrangements for you 
to take the exam early. </p>
<p>If you miss an exam unexpectedly and wish to have the absence considered 
excused, then you must meet with the me at the earliest opportunity possible 
after the absence, and provide documentation to support your claim that the 
absence should be considered excused. If the absence is excused, then I will 
substitute the average number of points of your other exams for the missed exam.</p>
<p align="left">For unexcused absences from examinations you will unfortunately 
receive a score of zero points.</p>
<h1>Academic Honesty / 
Misconduct and Collaboration</h1>
<p>In this course, students are expected to uphold the Honor Code of Mississippi 
State University: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>As a Mississippi State University student I will conduct myself with honor 
  and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor will I accept 
  the actions of those who do.</p>
  <p>Upon accepting admission to Mississippi State University, a student 
  immediately assumes a commitment to uphold the Honor Code, to accept 
  responsibility for learning, and to follow the philosophy and rules of the 
  Honor Code.&nbsp; Students will be required to state their commitment on 
  examinations, research papers, and other academic work.&nbsp; Ignorance of the 
  rules does not exclude any member of the MSU community from the requirements 
  or the processes of the Honor Code. </p>
  <p>For additional information please visit:
  <a href="http://www.msstate.edu/dept/audit/1207.html">
  http://www.msstate.edu/dept/audit/1207.html</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Students are also expected to maintain the standards of academic honesty that 
are described in the <a href="http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/honesty.php">
Department of Computer Science and Engineering's Academic Honesty Policy</a>.&nbsp; 
These standards apply in their entirety to the<b> midterm </b>and the <b>
final exam</b>.&nbsp; However, in the real world people work in teams, and games will be 
developed collaboratively by teams of students. </p>
<p>As a professor at Mississippi State University, I am required to report all 
incidents of academic misconduct.</p>
<h1>Additional Policies</h1>
<p><b>Attendance and Audits</b>: Attendance is required in this class.&nbsp; 
As discussed above, attendance my influence a student&#39;s grade through 
Instructor Feedback on game design assignments. In addition, I will take roll, and I will 
list absences on midterm and final grade reports. Students who miss class are 
still responsible for the material covered and for any assignments distributed.&nbsp; 
Students who are auditing the course must attend at least 75% of the class 
meetings in order to receive a passing grade.</p>
<p><b>Personal Electronic Devices</b>: Students must respect their fellow 
students and not disrupt class. Therefore, cell phones, pagers, other such 
alarms, or personal conversations which disturb the lecture are not allowed.&nbsp; 
Students with personal laptops are encouraged to bring them to class; however, laptops are not 
required for this course.</p>
<p><b>Grade of Incomplete (I)</b>: Following MSU policy, incomplete grades will 
only be given in extreme circumstances, such as illness, death in a student's 
immediate family, or similar circumstances beyond a student's control. </p>
<p><b>No Food or Drinks in Class</b>: It is the CSE department's policy that you 
can't eat or dink in Butler hall classrooms. </p>
<p><b>Drop / Add Policy</b>: This class follows
<a href="http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/add_drop.php">Mississippi State 
University's Official Drop/Add Policy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Add/drop without penalty</b>: A student has through the fifth class day 
  into the semester to add a course and through the tenth class day to drop a 
  course without being assessed a fee or academic penalty. </p>
  <p><b>Drop after the tenth class day through the 30th class day into the 
  semester</b>: A student who elects to drop a course during this period must 
  receive the approval of his/her advisor, will be assigned a W on his/her 
  academic record, and be assessed a fee. The advisor who permits the drop will 
  specify its effective date.</p>
  <p><b>Drop after the 30th class day into the semester</b>: A student cannot 
  drop courses after this period except in documented cases of serious illness, 
  extreme hardship, or failure of the instructor to provide significant 
  assessment of his/her performance. A request to drop a course during this 
  period must be approved by the student's advisor and academic dean. The dean 
  who permits the drop will specify its effective date. A student receiving 
  permission to drop will receive a W on his/her academic record and be assessed 
  a fee. </p>
  <p>Faculty are expected to provide a student with significant evidence or 
  assessment of his/her class performance within the first six weeks. </p>
