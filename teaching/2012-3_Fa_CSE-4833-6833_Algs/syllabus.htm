        <p><span class="parlabel">Homework Assignments</span>: We will have 5
        to 6 homework assignments during the semester.&nbsp; Most of the
        questions will be chosen from the exercises given at the end of each
        chapter in our textbook.&nbsp; Students taking CSE 6833 will generally
        have several extra questions to answer; students taking CSE 4833 will
        not be required to answer these extra questions.&nbsp; As described
        under the section on Collaboration below, I allow a greater degree of
        collaboration on homework assignments than is allowed under the
        strictest possible interpretation of the CSE Department's Undergraduate
        and Graduate Studies Academic Honesty Policies.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Homework assignments will always be due on class days, and will be
        due at the beginning of the class period.&nbsp; On days when homework
        is due, we will spend most of &mdash; and likely the entire &mdash;
        class meeting going over the homework questions.&nbsp; After this class
        meeting, you will have up to 24 hours to resubmit any homework
        question(s) that you desire; these resubmitted questions will add
        points to your homework grade.&nbsp; Homework questions turned in after
        the beginning of the class period will be considered
        resubmissions.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>You should take the homework assignments seriously &mdash; they are
        the best way to learn the material in this course.&nbsp; If you cannot
        complete a homework assignment in time, turn it in late, both to
        collect some points and to further study and learn the material!</p>

        <p><a href="Homework.htm">Additional details on homework assignments
        and how the resubmissions are graded</a>.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Midterm Exams</span>: We will have two
        midterm exams during the semester.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Final Exam</span>: Our final exam will be
        given during the scheduled final exam time.</p>

        <h2>Grading and Appeals</h2>

        <p>I will be working with a grader this semester.&nbsp; If you disagree
        with a grade, you need to provide me with a written appeal.&nbsp;
        Although you can discuss a grade with me, I generally won't make a
        decision regarding the grade based on a discussion, but only on a
        written appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Academic Honesty / Misconduct and Collaboration</h2>

        <p>In this course, students are expected to uphold the <a target=
        "_blank" href="http://students.msstate.edu/honorcode/">Mississippi
        State University Honor Code</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"As a Mississippi State University student I will conduct myself
          with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or
          steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do."</p>

          <p>Upon accepting admission to Mississippi State University, a
          student immediately assumes a commitment to uphold the Honor Code, to
          accept responsibility for learning, and to follow the philosophy and
          rules of the Honor Code.&nbsp; Students will be required to state
          their commitment on examinations, research papers, and other academic
          work.&nbsp; Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the
          MSU community from the requirements or the processes of the Honor
          Code.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Students are also expected to maintain the standards of academic
        honesty that are described in the <a target="_blank" href=
        "http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/understud/honesty.php">CSE
        Department's Undergraduate Studies Academic Honesty Policy</a> (CSE
        4833), or the <a target="_blank" href=
        "http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/gradstud/honesty.php">CSE
        Department's Graduate Studies Academic Honesty Policy</a> (CSE
        6833).&nbsp; These standards apply in their entirety to the <b>midterm
        exams</b> and the <b>final exam</b>.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>However, in the real world people work in groups.&nbsp; I encourage
        students to collaborate on <b>homework assignments</b> in terms of
        <i>discussing general approaches</i>.&nbsp; Students may also assist
        each other in <i>algorithm debugging</i>.&nbsp; However, <i>the
        solution for each assignment must be written individually by each
        student</i>.&nbsp; This means do not turn in answers downloaded off the
        Internet or accessed by other means.&nbsp; Do not turn in someone
        else's work as if it were your own.&nbsp; Do not turn in an answer that
        is a carbon-copy of somebody else's answer.&nbsp; Do not turn in an
        answer that you cannot verbally explain to the Professor or the
        Grader.</p>

        <p>These are important policies.&nbsp; Not only will violators fail to
        learn the course material, but violators will receive an "XF" in this
        course, and will otherwise be handled according the CSE Department's
        Undergraduate or Graduate Studies Academic Honesty Policies, as well as
        the <a href="http://www.honorcode.msstate.edu/policy/" target=
        "_blank">Academic Operating Policy and Procedure of Mississippi State
        University</a>.</p>

        <p>As a professor at Mississippi State University, I am required to
        report all incidents of academic misconduct.</p>

        <h2>Missed Exams</h2>

        <p>Occasionally students miss examinations.&nbsp; Sometimes the student
        knows about these absences in advance, and sometimes they happen
        unexpectedly.&nbsp; If you know in advance that you will be absent and
        you wish to have the absence considered excused, then you must meet
        with me before the date of the exam, and I will let you know whether or
        not the absence will be excused.&nbsp; If your excused absence will
        occur during an exam, then I will make arrangements for you to take the
        exam early.</p>

        <p>If you miss an exam unexpectedly and wish to have the absence
        considered excused, then you must meet with me at the earliest
        opportunity possible after the absence, and provide documentation to
        support your claim that the absence should be considered excused.&nbsp;
        If the absence is excused, then I will substitute the average number of
        points of your other exams for the missed exam.</p>

        <p>For unexcused absences from examinations you will unfortunately
        receive a score of zero points.</p>

        <h2>Additional Policies</h2>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Attendance and Audits</span>: Attendance is
        required in this class.&nbsp; Although attendance will not affect your
        grade, I will take roll, and I will list absences on midterm and final
        grade reports.&nbsp; Students who miss class are still responsible for
        the material covered and for any assignments distributed.&nbsp;
        Students who are auditing the course must attend at least 75% of the
        class meetings in order to receive a passing grade.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Personal Electronic Devices</span>: Students
        must respect their fellow students and not disrupt class. Therefore,
        cell phones, pagers, other such alarms, or personal conversations which
        disturb the lecture are not allowed.&nbsp; Students may bring laptops
        to class; however, laptops are not required for this course.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Grade of Incomplete (I)</span>: Following MSU
        policy, incomplete grades will only be given in extreme circumstances,
        such as illness, death in a student's immediate family, or similar
        circumstances beyond a student's control.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">No Food or Drinks in Class</span>: It is the
        CSE department's policy that you can't eat or dink in Butler hall
        classrooms.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Email</span>: When I send class-related
        email, I will use your <a href=
        "mailto:student_netid@msstate.edu">student_netid@msstate.edu</a> email
        address.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Drop / Add Policy</span>: This class follows
        <a target="_blank" href=
        "http://www.msstate.edu/dept/audit/1201.html">Mississippi State
        University's Official Drop/Add Policy</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><b>A.&nbsp;&nbsp; Add/Drop without penalty</b> - A student has
          through the fifth class day into the semester to drop a course and
          through the sixth class day to add a course without being assessed a
          fee or academic penalty.</p>

          <p><b>B.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drop after the fifth class day through the 30th
          class day into the semester</b> - A student who elects to drop a
          course during this period must receive the approval of his/her
          advisor, will be assigned a W on his/her academic record, and be
          assessed a fee.&nbsp; The advisor who permits the drop will specify
          its effective date.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><b>C.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drop after the 30th class day into the
          semester</b> &ndash; A student cannot drop courses after this period
          except in documented cases of serious illness, extreme hardship, or
          failure of the instructor to provide significant assessment of
          his/her performance.&nbsp;&nbsp; A request to drop a course during
          this period must be approved by the student&rsquo;s advisor and
          academic dean.&nbsp; The dean who permits the drop will specify its
          effective date.&nbsp; A student receiving permission to drop will
          receive a W on his/her academic record and be assessed a fee.</p>

          <p><b>D.</b>&nbsp; Faculty are expected to provide a student with
          significant evidence or assessment of his/her class performance
          within the first 30 class days of the semester.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Right to Change</h2>

        <p>I reserve the right to change the course policies or schedule in
        order to facilitate instruction. Any such changes will be discussed in
        class and updated on the course web site.</p>
