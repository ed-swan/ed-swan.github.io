</center>
<p><b><u>Group HCI Design Project</u></b>: The largest component of your grade 
will be based on a semester-long group HCI design project.&nbsp; Further details 
are given below.</p>
<p><u><b>Mid-term Exam</b></u>: There will be one in-class test near the middle 
of the semester. The test will consist of short answer and essay questions. </p>
<p><b><u>Final Exam</u></b>: The final exam will have the same format as the 
mid-term, and will be non-cumulative, covering only material from the second 
half of the semester. </p>
<p><u><b>Activities, Quizzes, Homework</b></u>: There will be approximately 10 
in-class activities throughout the semester. Activities will have either a 
written component for students to prepare individually in advance, a quiz to 
test students’ preparation for the activity, or a group assignment to be done in 
class.&nbsp; Homework assignments are due by class time on the due date; 
homework will not be accepted after the beginning of class. </p>
<h1>Group HCI Design Project</h1>
<p>You will be assigned to a group of 3--5 students early in the semester.&nbsp; 
Your group will design a human-computer interface utilizing the scenario-based 
design methodology discussed in our book.&nbsp; The group HCI design project 
grade is broken down like this: </p>
<center>
<table cellspacing="3" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Phase 1:</td>
    <td>10%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Phase 2:</td>
    <td>10%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Phase 3:</td>
    <td>10%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Phase 4:</td>
    <td>10%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Phase 5:</td>
    <td>10%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="right">Group Presentation:</td>
    <td>5%</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>The project will be divided into five phases, and each group will also make a 
group presentation to the class. </p>
<p><u><b>Project Deadlines</b></u>: Project reports for each phase are due by 
email by the time specified in the phase specification.&nbsp; Project reports up 
to 24 hours late will have 10% deducted.&nbsp; After 24 hours, late project 
reports will not be accepted. </p>
<p><u><b>Project Grading and Group Work</b></u>: Each member of a project group 
will receive the same grade for each phase of the project. Group work can be 
difficult at times, but it can also be very rewarding and provide good 
experience for work in real-world software development teams.&nbsp; Each group 
member is expected to contribute equally, and groups are expected to work out 
minor problems among themselves.&nbsp; In extreme cases, the instructor will 
mediate group problems, but groups must agree to abide by the instructor's 
decision in such cases. </p>
<p><u><b>Attendance and Group Work</b></u>: In cases of in-class group 
activities, only group members who are present will receive a grade for the 
activity.&nbsp; Absent group members will receive a zero for the activity. </p>
<h1>The WebCT Message Boards and Email</h1>
<p>In this class, the WebCT message boards are the main communication interface 
between the instructor, the grader, and your fellow students. Do not send email 
to the instructor with questions about assignments; post these to the discussion 
boards instead. Often, other students may be able to answer your question before 
the instructor.&nbsp; My goal is for the course to build upon a collaborative 
environment.</p>
<p>Since there may be frequent list activity, check the boards at least once a 
day. Students are responsible for knowing any material posted by the instructor.</p>
<p>The boards are a forum for discussion related to this class. Therefore, do 
not post rude or irrelevant messages. In addition, while general approaches can 
be discussed, exact or partial solutions (including code detailed snippets) are 
not allowed.&nbsp; Everyone is to do their own work.</p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: bold;">Academic Honesty</span></h1>
<p>Students are expected to maintain the standards of academic honesty that are 
described in the <a href="http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/honesty.php">
Department of Computer Science and Engineering's Academic Honesty Policy</a>.&nbsp; 
All work on homework assignments and exams is to be your own.&nbsp; Projects are 
to be completed by the members of the project group. Project reports should 
provide full citations for any sources (including articles, books, websites, 
etc.). Plagiarism is strictly prohibited.&nbsp; Suspected violations will be 
taken seriously and will be handled according the
<a href="http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/honesty.php">Academic Honesty 
Policy</a>.&nbsp; Please ask the instructor if you have any questions related to 
the honor code. </p>
<h1>Missed Exams</h1>
<p>Occasionally students miss examinations. Sometimes the student knows about 
these absences in advance, and sometimes they happen unexpectedly.&nbsp; If you 
know in advance that you will be absent and you wish to have the absence 
considered excused, then you must meet with me before the date of the exam, and 
I will let you know whether or not the absence will be excused.&nbsp; If your 
excused absence will occur during an exam, then I will make arrangements for you 
to take the exam early. </p>
<p>If you miss an exam unexpectedly and wish to have the absence considered 
excused, then you must meet with the me at the earliest opportunity possible 
after the absence, and provide documentation to support your claim that the 
absence should be considered excused. If the absence is excused, then I will 
substitute the average number of points of your other exams for the missed exam.</p>
<p align="left">For unexcused absences from examinations you will unfortunately 
receive a score of zero points.</p>
<h1>Additional Policies</h1>
<p><b>Attendance and Audits</b>: Attendance is required in this class.&nbsp; 
Although attendance will not affect your grade, I will take roll, and I will 
list absences on midterm and final grade reports. Students who miss class are 
still responsible for the material covered and for any assignments distributed.&nbsp; 
Students who are auditing the course must attend at least 75% of the class 
meetings in order to receive a passing grade.</p>
<p><b>Personal Electronic Devices</b>: Students must respect their fellow 
students and not disrupt class. Therefore, cell phones, pagers, other such 
alarms, or personal conversations which disturb the lecture are not allowed.&nbsp; 
Students with personal laptops may bring them to class; however, laptops are not 
required for this course.</p>
<p><b>Grade of Incomplete (I)</b>: Incomplete grades will only be given in 
extreme circumstances, such as illness, death in a student's immediate family, 
or similar circumstances beyond a student's control. </p>
<p><b>No Food or Drinks in Class</b>: It is the CSE department's policy that you 
can't eat or dink in Butler 100. </p>
<p><b>Drop / Add Policy</b>: This class follows
<a href="http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/add_drop.php">Mississippi State 
University's Official Drop/Add Policy</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-style: normal"><b>Add/drop without penalty</b>: A student 
  has through the fifth class day into the semester to add a course and through 
  the tenth class day to drop a course without being assessed a fee or academic 
  penalty. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-style: normal"><b>Drop after the tenth class day through 
  the 30th class day into the semester</b>: A student who elects to drop a 
  course during this period must receive the approval of his/her advisor, will 
  be assigned a W on his/her academic record, and be assessed a fee. The advisor 
  who permits the drop will specify its effective date.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-style: normal"><b>Drop after the 30th class day into the 
  semester</b>: A student cannot drop courses after this period except in 
  documented cases of serious illness, extreme hardship, or failure of the 
  instructor to provide significant assessment of his/her performance. A request 
  to drop a course during this period must be approved by the student's advisor 
  and academic dean. The dean who permits the drop will specify its effective 
  date. A student receiving permission to drop will receive a W on his/her 
  academic record and be assessed a fee. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-style: normal">Faculty are expected to provide a student 
  with significant evidence or assessment of his/her class performance within 
  the first six weeks. </span></p>
