          <dt>Catalog Description</dt>

          <dd>One hour lecture.&nbsp; Study of major social and ethical issues
          in computing, including history of computing, impact of computers on
          society, and the computer professional's code of ethics.</dd>

          <dt>Course Goals</dt>

          <dd>Students will develop an awareness of their responsibilities and
          duties as computing professionals.&nbsp; Students will also acquire
          an appreciation for the history of the computing discipline and their
          place in it.&nbsp; They will analyze the social implications of the
          rapid computerization of our culture.&nbsp; They will also consider
          various computer crimes, how these crimes arise, and methods for
          preventing them.&nbsp; In addition, students will argue both sides of
          various computing-related issues and controversies.&nbsp; Finally,
          students will formulate their own code describing their moral and
          ethical responsibilities as computing professionals, and compare it
          to other major computer ethics codes. </dd>

        <h2>Class Format</h2>

        <p>By your senior year, you, as an emergent computer professional,
        should have developed enough of an understanding of and identification
        with your field to understand and accept its code of ethics.&nbsp; This
        course will be taught mostly by you and your fellow students, as a
        seminar.&nbsp; In the seminar environment, we hope that you will try to
        thrash out these important social issues yourself, justifying to
        yourself and internalizing the ethical attitudes of responsible members
        of your chosen profession.&nbsp; This course will require you to
        present formal oral presentations, write short "my opinion" papers, and
        participate in informal weekly discussions.&nbsp; For the final exam
        you will write a case study paper.&nbsp; The goal of these assignments
        is to help you consider important ethical dimensions of computing, as
        you move from the protected academic environment to the real world of
        your first professional full-time employment after
        graduation.&nbsp;</p>

        <h3><br>
        Oral Presentation:</h3>

        <p>Each student will make a ~20-minute oral presentation to the class
        during the semester, and will then lead the class discussion on this
        topic for the rest of the class session.&nbsp; This presentation will
        be concerned with one of the sub-areas under discussion on the day of
        his or her oral presentation and should consist of a summary of and
        introduction to the material being discussed.</p>

        <p>Students will be assigned a topic from those listed in the course
        outline.&nbsp; Students will research their topics, take notes, outline
        their talk, and prepare a presentation using visual aids such as
        slides.&nbsp; On the scheduled date, each student will deliver their
        talk, and then lead the discussion during the rest of the class.&nbsp;
        Students will turn in their slides after their talk.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>You will be graded on the depth and originality of your analysis of
        the topic; the number and quality of your bibliographic citations; the
        organization, clarity, and persuasiveness of your class presentation;
        the effectiveness of your visual aids, and how appropriately you use
        your time.</p>

        <h3>My Opinion Papers:</h3>

        <p>Each student will write 6 short (~500 words) "my opinion" papers on
        various topics that arise during the class discussion.&nbsp; These
        papers will express your personal position regarding a computer ethics
        topic.&nbsp; Each paper should&nbsp; include (1) a clear statement of
        your opinion, (2) a well-reasoned discussion of the factors involved in
        the issue and a justification of why you hold your opinion, with (3)
        reference to one or more philosophical theories of ethics.&nbsp; The
        instructor will suggest various topics for the my opinion papers, but
        students may also select their own topics.</p>

        <p>Since a student's opinion cannot be judged to be "right" or "wrong",
        these papers will be graded on how thoroughly and deeply the issue is
        analyzed and explored and on how well the student expresses and defends
        their ideas.&nbsp; The papers will also be graded on the proper use of
        grammar, spelling, and punctuation.</p>

        <p>Each my opinion paper will have an announced due date; late my
        opinion papers will not be accepted.</p>

        <h3>Final Case Study Paper:</h3>

        <p>The final exam for this class will be a case study paper,
        approximately 5 to 10 pages in length.&nbsp; The paper must discuss a
        case that is relevant to our study of computer ethics.&nbsp; The goals
        of the paper are to summarize the case, analyze it, and discuss your
        reaction to it.&nbsp; This paper will be due at the beginning of the
        last regular class meeting.&nbsp;</p>

        <h3>Class Participation:</h3>

        <p>This part of the grade will depend upon attending class and
        participating in the class discussion.&nbsp; Each unexcused absence
        will cost 2 points of participation grade; up to a total of 10 points
        for 5 unexcused absences.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Students who are auditing the course must attend at least 75% of the
        class meetings in order to receive a passing grade.</p>

        <h2>Exceptional Circumstances</h2>

        <p>A student who misses class or is late with an assignment, and who
        feels their situation is due to exceptional circumstances, should
        immediately discuss the matter with the instructor, and the instructor
        may waive the late penalty and/or grant an appropriate extension.</p>

        <h2>Writing Assistance</h2>

        <p><span class="parlabel">From Technical Communication Tutors</span>:
        The <a href=
        "http://www.bagley.msstate.edu/programs/technicalcommunication/Tutor/index.php">
        Shackouls Technical Communication Program</a> provides writing tutors
        each semester to assist you with all writing-related issues, from
        routine writing assignments for your classes to senior-design reports,
        theses, and job-application materials.&nbsp; You may email electronic
        copies of your documents in Word or PDF form to the writing tutors for
        them to check; be sure to submit them early enough for the tutors to be
        able to return your papers prior to the due date.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">From Each Other</span>: You may also partner
        with others in the class to proof-read each other's papers.&nbsp; Any
        writer will tell you that proof-reading is an excellent way to improve
        your own writing.&nbsp; However, you must ensure that proof-reading
        does not cross the line and become writing your fellow student's paper
        for them; this would constitute academic misconduct.&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Academic Honesty / Misconduct and Collaboration</h2>

        <p>In this course, students are expected to uphold the <a target=
        "_blank" href="http://students.msstate.edu/honorcode/">Mississippi
        State University Honor Code</a>:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"As a Mississippi State University student I will conduct myself
          with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or
          steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do."</p>

          <p>Upon accepting admission to Mississippi State University, a
          student immediately assumes a commitment to uphold the Honor Code, to
          accept responsibility for learning, and to follow the philosophy and
          rules of the Honor Code.&nbsp; Students will be required to state
          their commitment on examinations, research papers, and other academic
          work.&nbsp; Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the
          MSU community from the requirements or the processes of the Honor
          Code.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Students are also expected to maintain the standards of academic
        honesty that are described in the <a href=
        "http://www.cse.msstate.edu/academics/understud/honesty.php" target=
        "_blank">CSE Department's Undergraduate Studies Academic Honesty
        Policy</a> (CSE 4833).&nbsp; These are important policies.&nbsp; Not
        only will violators fail to learn the course material, but violators
        will receive an "XF" in this course, and will otherwise be handled
        according the CSE Department's Undergraduate or Graduate Studies
        Academic Honesty Policies, as well as the <a href=
        "http://www.honorcode.msstate.edu/policy/" target="_blank">Academic
        Operating Policy and Procedure of Mississippi State University</a>.</p>

        <p>As a professor at Mississippi State University, I am required to
        report all incidents of academic misconduct.</p>

        <p>In terms of academic misconduct, in this course there are two
        primary dangers: (1) using somebody else's writing as your own, and (2)
        failing to properly cite your sources.&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Right to Change</h2>

        <p>I reserve the right to change the course policies or schedule in
        order to facilitate instruction.&nbsp; Any such changes will be
        discussed in class and updated on the course web site.</p>

        <h2>Additional Policies</h2>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Personal Electronic Devices</span>: Students
        must respect their fellow students and not disrupt class. Therefore,
        cell phones, pagers, other such alarms, or personal conversations which
        disturb the lecture are not allowed.&nbsp; Students with personal
        laptops are encouraged to bring them to class; however, laptops are not
        required for this course.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Grade of Incomplete (I)</span>: Following MSU
        policy, incomplete grades will only be given in extreme circumstances,
        such as illness, death in a student's immediate family, or similar
        circumstances beyond a student's control.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">No Food or Drinks in Class</span>: It is the
        CSE department's policy that you can't eat or dink in Butler Hall
        classrooms.</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Email</span>: When I send class-related
        email, I will use your <a href=
        "mailto:student_netid@msstate.edu">student_netid@msstate.edu</a> email
        address.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><span class="parlabel">Drop / Add Policy</span>: This class follows

          except in documented cases of serious illness, extreme hardship, or
          failure of the instructor to provide significant assessment of
          his/her performance.&nbsp;&nbsp; A request to drop a course during
          this period must be approved by the student&rsquo;s advisor and
          academic dean.&nbsp; The dean who permits the drop will specify its
          effective date.&nbsp; A student receiving permission to drop will
