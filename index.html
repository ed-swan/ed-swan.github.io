          <p>Dr. <em>J. Edward Swan II</em> is the Interim Associate Dean of Research
          for the Bagley College of Engineering at Mississippi State
          University, and the Virginia Carron Eiland and Brent Eiland Professor
          of Computer Science and Engineering. In 2017 and 2018, he served as
          Interim Department Head. He holds a B.S. (1989) degree in computer
          science from Auburn University and M.S. (1992) and Ph.D. (1997)
          degrees in computer science from Ohio State University, where he
          studied computer graphics and human-computer interaction. Before
          joining Mississippi State University in 2004, he spent seven years as
          a scientist at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C. Dr.
          Swanâ€™s research has centered on the topics of augmented and virtual
          reality, perception, data science, empirical methods, human-computer
          interaction, human factors, and visualization. Currently, he is
          studying the perception and technology required to give virtual
          objects definite spatial locations, including depth and layout
          perception and depth presentation methods. He is also studying
          efficient data science tools. His research has been funded by the
          National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, the National
          Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Naval Research Laboratory,
          and the Office of Naval Research. Dr. Swan is a member of ACM, IEEE,
          and the IEEE Computer Society. He has served many roles in the
          Visualization and Graphics Technical Communities (VGTC) of IEEE
          Virtual Reality (VR), IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and
          Augmented Reality (ISMAR), and IEEE Visualization. He is currently
          the chair of the IEEE VR steering committee. Previously, he served as
          one of the general chairs of VR 2021 and VR 2020, as well as a
          program chair for ISMAR 2017, ISMAR 2016, VR 2015, and VR 2014, and
          he was a member of the ISMAR steering committee. His scholarship and
          service have been recently recognized by induction into the 2024
          Class of the VGTC Virtual Reality Academy, the 2023 VGTC Virtual
          Reality Service Award, and the 2022 ISMAR Impact Paper Award.</p>
